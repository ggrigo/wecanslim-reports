                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the charts, there appears to be a recent breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern. The most recent buy point was around $115.50, which formed after a period of consolidation.

2. Buy Range: Given the current price of $117.57 and the identified buy point, we can establish a buy range of $115.50 to $121.28 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: At $117.57, the stock is approximately 1.8% above the buy point of $115.50, so it is not extended from its proper buy point.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 12% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not immediately near its high but showing strong recovery momentum.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 115.50,
    "buy_range_min": 115.50,
    "buy_range_max": 121.28,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with an A accumulation/distribution rating
- Volume is running 21% above average, indicating good institutional interest
- The RS line is showing strength (RS Rating 88)
- The stock has strong fundamentals with impressive EPS growth (30%) and sales growth (28%)
- The current pattern shows healthy consolidation with support at the 50-day moving average

The combination of strong technical and fundamental factors makes this a potentially attractive CAN SLIM candidate, though investors should maintain strict sell rules and monitor market conditions carefully.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the daily chart, the stock appears to be forming a cup-with-handle pattern. The most recent consolidation shows a potential buy point around $375, which would be near the left-side high of the current pattern.

2. Buy Range: Given the stock's volatility and the identified buy point, a reasonable buy range would be between $375 (buy point) and $393.75 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size: Given the stock's high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and relatively high RS Rating of 96, a moderate position size would be prudent. The strong fundamental ratings (Composite 98, EPS 84) support a position but warrant caution due to volatility.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $367.78, which is below the potential buy point of $375. Therefore, it is not extended from a proper buy point.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 11% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics. This suggests it's in a consolidation phase rather than near its high.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 375.00,
    "buy_range_min": 375.00,
    "buy_range_max": 393.75,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS 96) and institutional support (B accumulation rating)
- Volume patterns show healthy accumulation
- The 50-day moving average is trending upward, providing potential support
- The high Composite Rating (98) and EPS Rating (84) support the technical setup
- Current consolidation appears healthy with normal base-building characteristics
- The stock's high P/E ratio (92.18) suggests additional risk consideration is warranted

The stock appears to be setting up a potentially valid entry point, but traders should wait for confirmation of the breakout with strong volume before entering a position.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent one being at $248.74. This appears to be a breakout from a three-weeks-tight pattern, which is a valid CAN SLIM buy pattern. Previous buy points were at $217.50 and $201.03.

2. Buy Range: Given the current buy point of $248.74, the buy range would extend up to approximately $261.18 (5% above the buy point). However, the stock is currently trading at $248.35, which is right at the buy point.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 94 RS Rating) but high volatility and elevated P/E ratio (322.53), a moderate position size would be appropriate. 

4. Extended Status: The stock is not currently extended from its buy point. In fact, it's trading right at the buy point level.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is very close to its high, only 2% off its 52-week high according to the fundamental metrics.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 248.74,
    "buy_range_min": 248.74,
    "buy_range_max": 261.18,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is clearly defined by the three-weeks-tight pattern at $248.74
- The buy range follows the standard CAN SLIM rule of buying within 5% of the buy point
- Position size recommendation is conservative due to the high P/E ratio and market volatility
- The stock is not extended as it's trading right at the buy point
- The 2% distance from 52-week high confirms it's near its high

The stock shows strong technical and fundamental characteristics with high ratings across most CAN SLIM metrics, though investors should note the elevated P/E ratio as a potential risk factor.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF) charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows two recent buy points:
- First at $61.75 with a buy zone up to $64.84
- Second at $63.70 with a buy zone up to $66.89
The most recent buy point at $63.70 appears to be from a three-weeks-tight pattern.

2. Buy Range: Based on the most recent buy point of $63.70:
- Lower end: $63.70 (buy point)
- Upper end: $66.89 (5% above buy point)

3. Position Size: Given that this is a Bitcoin ETF with:
- High RS Rating of 92
- Relatively high volatility
- Current market conditions
A conservative position size of 5-7% would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $64.22, the stock is:
- Within the buy range of the $63.70 buy point
- Not extended from its proper buy point

5. Proximity to High: 
- Currently 8% off its 52-week high
- Showing strong relative strength (RS 92)
- In an upward trend with healthy consolidation

Here's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 63.70,
    "buy_range_min": 63.70,
    "buy_range_max": 66.89,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength with an RS Rating of 92
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The stock is trading above its key moving averages
- The three-weeks-tight pattern suggests institutional accumulation
- Current price action suggests the stock is in a buyable range</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a cup-with-handle pattern. The buy point appears to be around $63.90, which is 10 cents above the handle's high. The pattern shows proper depth and duration, with strong relative strength throughout the base formation.

2. Buy Range:
With a buy point of $63.90, the maximum buy range would extend to approximately $67.10 (5% above the buy point). The current price of $63.61 is actually slightly below the buy point, suggesting the stock hasn't broken out yet.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 96 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate. The stock's presence in the IBD 50 and strong RS rating of 95 support this sizing recommendation.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended from its buy point. In fact, it's still forming the handle of the pattern and hasn't yet broken out.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is very close to its 52-week high, being only 4.8% off its high according to the fundamental metrics provided. This is generally a positive technical indicator.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 63.90,
    "buy_range_min": 63.90,
    "buy_range_max": 67.10,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with increasing volume patterns
- The relative strength line is in an uptrend, confirming the stock's strength
- The base pattern is well-formed with proper depth and time requirements
- Current market conditions and the stock's presence in IBD 50 support a potential breakout
- The stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, showing overall strength

The analysis suggests waiting for a breakout above $63.90 on heavy volume before initiating a position, while being mindful of the broader market conditions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent one at $246.60. This appears to be a breakout from a short consolidation period. Previous buy points were at $165.33 and $164.10, which are now well below current levels.

2. Buy Range: With the most recent buy point at $246.60, the buy range would typically extend 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at approximately $258.93. However, the stock has pulled back from this level.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but considering current market volatility and the -8.05% recent decline, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently NOT extended from its buy point. In fact, it has pulled back below the buy point of $246.60 to $225.27, putting it in a potential support zone.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 11.2% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics, suggesting it's in a pullback phase.

Here's the technical data output in JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 246.60,
    "buy_range_min": 246.60,

    "position_size": "moderate - 5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength with a 97 RS Rating
- Volume patterns show institutional support
- The current pullback could provide a potential entry point if the stock finds support and rebounds
- The stock has maintained its position above its 50-day moving average, which is generally positive
- Strong fundamentals support the technical picture with excellent EPS and RS ratings
- The current market conditions and volatility suggest careful position sizing and risk management</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows two clear buy points:
- First entry at $87.42 with a 5% buy zone up to $91.79
- Second entry at $95.23 with a 5% buy zone up to $99.99
The stock has formed a cup-with-handle pattern and is currently trading near the second buy point.

2. Buy Range: Based on the most recent buy point of $95.23:
- Lower end: $95.23 (buy point)
- Upper end: $99.99 (5% above buy point)

3. Position Size: Given the stock's characteristics:
- Strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating)
- High RS Rating (91)
- Moderate volatility
Recommend: 7-8% position size for aggressive growth investors

4. Extended Status: At $92.10, the stock is not extended from either buy point. It's actually trading below the most recent buy point of $95.23.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is only 5% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength.

Here's the formatted JSON output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 95.23,
    "buy_range_min": 95.23,
    "buy_range_max": 99.99,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with increasing fund ownership
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing accumulation
- The 10-week moving average is providing good support
- Strong fundamental metrics support the technical pattern
- The stock has maintained its uptrend while building this base pattern

The current price action and technical setup, combined with strong fundamentals, suggest this stock is setting up for a potential breakout above the $95.23 level.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a recent breakout from a flat base pattern with a buy point at $120.65. This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with strong volume confirmation on the breakout.

2. Buy Range: Given the buy point of $120.65, the standard buy range would extend to approximately $126.68 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size: Given the strong fundamental metrics (Composite Rating: 99, EPS Rating: 97) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $125.22, the stock is about 3.8% above its buy point of $120.65, so it's not yet extended beyond the proper buy range.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is very close to its 52-week high, showing only 3.5% off its high, indicating strong momentum.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 120.65,
    "buy_range_min": 120.65,
    "buy_range_max": 126.68,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with increasing volume on up days
- The RS line is making new highs, confirming the breakout's strength
- The stock has maintained support above its 50-day moving average
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing accumulation
- The flat base pattern is well-formed, meeting the technical criteria for a sound base

The combination of strong technical action and excellent fundamentals (99 Composite Rating) makes this a compelling CAN SLIM setup, though investors should remain vigilant about market conditions and maintain proper sell rules.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
The chart shows a clear buy point at $73.34, which was established during a previous breakout attempt. This level appears to have acted as both resistance and support.

2. Buy Range:
Given the $73.34 buy point, a standard 5% buy range would be from $73.34 to approximately $77.01. However, the stock is currently trading well below this range at $66.41.

3. Position Size:
Based on the stock's volatility (showing roughly 20-30% price swings) and the current technical setup, a conservative position size would be recommended. The stock shows above-average volatility with an RS Rating of 95.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended from its buy point. In fact, it's trading significantly below the potential buy point of $73.34, currently at $66.41.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 19.5% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics. This suggests it's not near its high and has room to run if it can establish a new uptrend.

Additional Observations:
- Strong RS Rating of 95 indicates excellent relative strength
- The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average
- Volume patterns show some institutional support
- Currently forming a potential base pattern

Here's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 73.34,
    "buy_range_min": 73.34,
    "buy_range_max": 77.01,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

The stock shows strong fundamental ratings (Composite 91) but is currently in a consolidation phase. Traders should wait for a proper breakout above $73.34 with strong volume before considering an entry. The current price action suggests a period of base-building, which could lead to a new breakout opportunity if market conditions improve.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the daily chart, the stock has recently formed what appears to be a flat base pattern with resistance around $108. The proper buy point would be $108.31 (adding 10 cents to the pattern high).

2. Buy Range: Given the buy point of $108.31, the buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, making the maximum buy range $113.73.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but considering its relatively high volatility as shown in the charts, a moderate position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $104.31, which is below the identified buy point. Therefore, it is not extended.

5. Proximity to High: With only 4.2% off its 52-week high and showing strong relative strength (RS Rating of 94), the stock is indeed near its highs.

Additional Observations:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with increasing volume patterns
- Moving averages are trending positively
- The RS line is near new highs, confirming price strength

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 108.31,
    "buy_range_min": 108.31,
    "buy_range_max": 113.73,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

The analysis is based on clear technical patterns visible in the charts, strong fundamental metrics, and adherence to CAN SLIM principles. The stock shows healthy consolidation and remains in a strong uptrend, making it a potential candidate for purchase once it reaches the buy point with proper volume confirmation.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent one at $34.23. This appears to be a breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern. The pattern shows proper consolidation and volume characteristics.

2. Buy Range: Given the $34.23 buy point, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, making the maximum buy point approximately $35.94.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (96 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $33.46, which is below the recent buy point of $34.23. Therefore, it is not extended and is actually pulling back within a normal range.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is 10.7% off its 52-week high, suggesting it's in a consolidation phase rather than near its high.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 34.23,
    "buy_range_min": 34.23,
    "buy_range_max": 35.94,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with excellent fundamentals (EPS Rating: 99, RS Rating: 94)
- Current pullback might present a buying opportunity as it's testing its 50-day moving average
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing proper institutional accumulation
- The stock has formed several constructive bases throughout its uptrend, indicating healthy price action
- Earnings are due on Aug. 14, which should be considered for timing any potential entries

The current setup suggests a potentially favorable risk/reward ratio for investors who can enter near the current price level, with clear stop-loss points below the 50-day moving average.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the daily chart, there appears to be a potential cup-with-handle formation forming, with a buy point around $200. However, the stock is currently trading below this level at $168.10 and showing some weakness. The stock had a previous high around $298.99.

2. Buy Range:
Given the current market conditions and the stock's position below potential buy points, it would be prudent to wait for a new base to form before establishing a buy range.

3. Position Size:
Given the high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and the relatively weak EPS rating (37), this would suggest a more conservative position size. The strong RS rating (98) is positive, but other metrics suggest caution.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended - in fact, it's trading 44% below its 52-week high, showing significant weakness.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is well off its highs, trading at $168.10 compared to the 52-week high of around $298.99.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "5-10%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Reasoning:
- Buy point is null because the stock needs to form a new base before a proper buy point can be established
- Buy range is null for the same reason - we need a new base formation
- Position size suggestion of 5-10% reflects the high volatility and mixed fundamental metrics
- Is_extended is false as the stock is well below previous highs
- Near_high is false as the stock is 44% off its 52-week high

Additional considerations:
- The high RS Rating (98) shows strong relative strength
- The weak EPS Rating (37) is concerning from a CAN SLIM perspective
- Volume patterns show distribution (selling pressure)
- The stock is trading below its 50-day moving average, suggesting current weakness

Recommendation would be to wait for a new base to form with proper buy points before considering entry.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the daily chart, there was a clear cup-with-handle pattern that formed with a buy point at $64.62 (marked on the chart). However, the stock is currently trading well above this level at $104.14 and has shown significant weakness after reaching highs around $180.

2. Buy Range: The stock is currently not in a proper buy range. It's in a downtrend, trading below its 50-day moving average, showing technical weakness.

3. Position Size: Given the high volatility (as seen in the wide price swings), poor fundamentals (EPS Rating of 16), and current technical weakness, this would warrant a smaller position size if considering a new position.

4. Extended Status: The stock is not currently extended from any proper buy point. In fact, it's showing technical weakness, down 44% from its 52-week high.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is well off its highs, trading at $104.14 compared to its apparent high around $180, representing a significant decline.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 64.62,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "avoid",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- While the stock has a strong RS Rating of 98, the poor EPS rating (16) and SMR Rating (D) suggest fundamental weakness
- The stock is showing high volatility with significant price swings
- Current price action shows distribution (selling pressure) with above-average volume on down days
- No current proper buy setup is visible; the stock needs to form a new base pattern before considering any entry points
- The combination of technical weakness and poor fundamentals suggests avoiding new positions at current levels

The buy range values are null because there is no valid current buy setup to establish a proper buy range. The position size recommendation is "avoid" due to the combination of technical weakness and poor fundamentals.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows two significant buy points:
- First at $108.50 (marked on chart)
- Second at $101.70 (marked on chart)
Currently, the stock appears to be working on a new base formation after reaching highs around $280.

2. Buy Range: Based on the current price action and previous patterns, a new buy point would likely emerge from the current consolidation. However, the stock is still forming its pattern and hasn't yet established a clear buy point.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 99 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: The stock is not currently extended from any buy point. In fact, it's in a correction phase, trading about 18.8% off its 52-week high.

5. Proximity to High: At $232.73, the stock is notably below its recent highs around $280, indicating it's not near its high.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "15-20%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Reasoning:
- Buy point is null because the stock is currently in a correction/base-building phase
- Buy range is null because we need to wait for a new base to complete and breakout point to form
- Position size suggestion of 15-20% is based on the strong fundamentals but current market volatility
- Not extended as it's well below previous highs
- Not near high as it's 18.8% off its 52-week high

Additional considerations:
- Strong RS Rating of 99 indicates excellent relative strength
- The stock has shown the ability to form proper bases and breakout successfully in the past
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional support
- Earnings are due August 6, which could be a catalyst for price movement</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the charts, there appears to be a base formation with a potential buy point around $142-143. The stock has been consolidating in a relatively tight range and shows signs of a possible flat base pattern. The weekly chart shows strong institutional support at the 10-week moving average.

2. Buy Range:
Given the identified buy point around $142-143, a reasonable buy range would extend 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at approximately $149-150.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the daily chart) and strong fundamentals (95 Composite Rating, 91 RS Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows both promise and risk factors.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently not extended from its buy point. At $137.32, it's actually trading below the potential buy point identified above.

5. Proximity to High:
According to the metrics provided, the stock is 24.4% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not currently near its high point.

Here's the technical data output in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 142.50,
    "buy_range_min": 142.50,
    "buy_range_max": 149.60,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamental metrics with a 95 Composite Rating
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The 10-week moving average is acting as support on the weekly chart
- The stock has strong relative strength (RS Rating: 91)
- The current consolidation pattern appears constructive
- Risk management is crucial given the stock's volatility and market conditions

These determinations are based on the visible chart patterns, technical indicators, and provided fundamental metrics. Traders should always use proper risk management and consider market conditions when making investment decisions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent one at $67.37. This appears to be coming from a cup-with-handle pattern formation. The chart also shows previous buy points at $65.89 and $35.02.

2. Buy Range: Based on the $67.37 buy point, the buy range would typically extend 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at approximately $70.74.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 98 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility as shown in the chart patterns, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently at $62.55, which is actually below the most recent buy point of $67.37, indicating it's not extended. In fact, it appears to have pulled back below the buy point.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 14.3% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics, suggesting it's not near its high point.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 67.37,
    "buy_range_min": 67.37,
    "buy_range_max": 70.74,
    "position_size": "7-8% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point of $67.37 is clearly marked on the chart and represents a breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern
- The buy range extends 5% above the buy point, which is standard for CAN SLIM methodology
- Position size recommendation is based on the strong fundamentals but acknowledging the volatility shown in the chart
- The stock is not extended as it's currently trading below the buy point
- The stock is showing a pullback of 14.3% from its high, indicating it's not near its high point

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamentals with a 99 Composite Rating
- Volume patterns show some institutional support
- The recent pullback might present a potential buying opportunity if the stock can recover and break above the buy point again with strong volume</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows two significant buy points marked on the weekly chart:
- An early entry at $13.62
- A deep base buy point at $15.92
The most recent proper buy point appears to be at $15.92, which came after forming a sound base pattern.

2. Buy Range: With the buy point at $15.92, the standard buy range would be:
- Lower bound: $15.92 (buy point)
- Upper bound: $16.72 (5% above buy point)

3. Position Size: Given the stock's characteristics:
- High volatility as shown in recent price action
- Strong RS Rating of 97
- Good Composite Rating of 96
A moderate position size of 5-7% would be appropriate to manage risk.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently at $15.40, which is actually below the recent buy point of $15.92. Therefore, it is not extended and is actually pulling back within the base.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is 28.5% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not currently near its high. The recent price action shows a pullback from around $20.

Here's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 15.92,
    "buy_range_min": 15.92,
    "buy_range_max": 16.72,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 97)
- Volume patterns show institutional support
- The current pullback might offer a potential entry point if the stock rebounds from support levels
- The stock's volatility suggests careful position sizing and stop-loss placement is crucial
- The strong sales growth (172%) and EPS growth (38%) support the technical setup</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide my technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology:

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the daily chart, the stock recently formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a breakout that occurred around $15. However, the stock is currently pulling back after reaching highs near $30. At current levels, there isn't a clear new buy point forming yet.

2. Buy Range: Given the current technical situation where the stock is in a pullback phase, there isn't a valid buy range to establish at this moment. We should wait for a new base to form.

3. Position Size: Given the high volatility shown in the charts (with moves from $15 to $30 and back to $22) and the poor EPS rating of 43, this would suggest a smaller position size than normal - perhaps 50% of a standard position.

4. Extended Status: The stock is not currently extended. In fact, it's pulling back from its recent highs and is below its 21-day moving average.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 30.8% off its 52-week high, so it's not near its high. The charts show it's in a correction phase after a strong run-up.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "half-sized position (2-4% of portfolio)",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock has strong relative strength (RS 98) but poor fundamentals (EPS 43)
- Volume is declining on the pullback, which is constructive
- The stock needs to form a new base before considering new entries
- Earnings are due August 7 after the close, which adds risk to any new positions
- The stock's volatile nature and poor earnings metrics suggest caution and smaller position sizing if entering

Recommendation: Wait for a new base to form and watch how the stock reacts to upcoming earnings before considering new positions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the charts, the stock has recently broken out of a cup-with-handle pattern. The most recent buy point was around $120, which served as a breakout from a consolidation period. However, the stock has pulled back after this breakout attempt.

2. Buy Range:
Given the current price of $125.03 and the recent volatility, a reasonable buy range would be between $120 (the breakout point) and $126 (5% above breakout).

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's high volatility (as seen in the daily price swings) and mixed fundamental metrics (low EPS rating but high RS rating), a conservative position size would be appropriate, suggesting 5-7% of portfolio.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended from its proper buy point. In fact, it's pulling back within the normal buy range.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 17% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not near its high point. The recent price action shows increased volatility.

Additional Observations:
- Strong RS Rating of 98 indicates excellent relative strength
- Poor EPS Rating of 19 suggests fundamental weakness
- High volume on recent price movements indicates institutional involvement

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 120.00,
    "buy_range_min": 120.00,
    "buy_range_max": 126.00,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Reasoning:
- Buy point is set at $120 based on the recent consolidation breakout level
- Buy range extends 5% above the buy point
- Conservative position size due to mixed technical and fundamental signals
- Stock is not extended as it's trading within the buy range
- Not near high as it's 17% off its 52-week high
- High RS rating but poor fundamentals suggest caution in position sizing

The stock shows strong relative strength but weak fundamentals, suggesting careful position sizing and strict adherence to stop-loss levels would be prudent.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
The chart shows a potential buy point at $230.41, which appears to be emerging from a cup-with-handle pattern. There's also a previous entry point noted at $78.08, but that's no longer relevant for current trading decisions.

2. Buy Range:
Given the buy point of $230.41, a reasonable buy range would extend to about 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at approximately $241.93.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's high volatility (as evidenced by the wide price swings) and the relatively high RS Rating of 97, a conservative position size would be appropriate. The strong fundamentals (92 Composite Rating) but high P/E ratio (171.49) suggest some caution.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $188.64, the stock is not extended from its potential buy point of $230.41. In fact, it's trading below this level.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 18.1% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics, suggesting it's not near its high.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 230.41,
    "buy_range_min": 230.41,
    "buy_range_max": 241.93,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 97)
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional support
- The stock is currently building a potential base pattern
- The 50-day moving average is providing support
- The high EPS growth (850%) and sales growth (78%) are positive indicators
- The stock's current price action suggests it's in a consolidation phase, which could lead to a new buying opportunity if it breaks out above the suggested buy point with strong volume</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
The chart shows two clear buy points:
- First at $119.47 (marked on chart)
- Second at $170 (recent breakout attempt)
The most recent buy point at $170 appears to be from a cup-with-handle pattern formation.

2. Buy Range:
Based on the $170 buy point:
- Buy range would be $170 to $178.50 (5% above buy point)
The stock is currently trading at $154.21, below the buy point.

3. Position Size:
Given the metrics:
- High Composite Rating (99)
- Strong RS Rating (95)
- Good volume characteristics
- But high volatility shown in chart
Recommended position size: 5-7% of portfolio

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended. In fact, it's trading below the recent buy point of $170, suggesting a failed breakout attempt.

5. Proximity to High:
Currently 11% off its 52-week high, as confirmed by the fundamental metrics.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 170.00,
    "buy_range_min": 170.00,
    "buy_range_max": 178.50,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamental ratings (99 Composite, 95 RS)
- Volume patterns show institutional support
- The recent pullback from $170 suggests caution
- The stock is currently consolidating and may need time to build a new base
- Traders should wait for a new buy point to emerge with strong volume confirmation before entering new positions

The current price action suggests a wait-and-see approach rather than immediate entry, despite the strong fundamental metrics.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the daily chart, the stock appears to be forming a flat base pattern with resistance around $32. The potential buy point would be $32.15, which represents a breakout above the base's resistance level.

2. Buy Range: Given the identified buy point of $32.15, a reasonable buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy price at $33.76.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the daily price swings) and strong fundamentals (97 Composite Rating), a moderate position size of 5-7% of the portfolio would be appropriate to balance opportunity with risk.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $30.01, which is below the potential buy point of $32.15. Therefore, it is not extended from a proper buy point.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is 23.1% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not currently near its high. The recent price action shows consolidation in a flat base pattern.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 32.15,
    "buy_range_min": 32.15,
    "buy_range_max": 33.76,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamental ratings (Composite 97, EPS 96, RS 96)
- Volume patterns show healthy accumulation with above-average volume on up days
- The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, showing relative strength
- The flat base formation appears technically sound with proper depth and duration
- The high volume spike on recent pullback suggests institutional support

These factors combine to present a potentially attractive setup once the stock reaches its buy point, though investors should wait for a proper breakout before establishing a position.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the daily and weekly charts, the stock appears to be forming a cup-with-handle pattern. The current price action shows a potential breakout point around $58-59, where there's previous resistance. However, the pattern isn't yet complete, so we can't definitively set a buy point.

2. Buy Range:
Since we don't have a confirmed buy point yet, we can't establish a precise buy range. However, when the pattern completes, the buy range would typically extend 5% above the breakout point.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's volatility (as seen in the price swings) and its strong RS Rating of 96, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows above-average volatility but has strong relative strength.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended from any proper buy point. In fact, it's consolidating and forming a potential base pattern.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 14.8% off its 52-week high, as confirmed by the fundamental metrics provided. This indicates it's not near its high, which could provide room for upside if a proper breakout occurs.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating
- The RS Rating of 96 is excellent, indicating strong market leadership
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional involvement
- The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, showing positive technical action
- The base formation needs more time to complete before establishing a proper buy point

The nulls in the buy point and range fields reflect that we don't yet have a completed technical pattern from which to derive these values. Traders should wait for a proper breakout before establishing positions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the daily and weekly charts, the stock appears to have recently broken out of a flat base pattern around $94. The base shows proper consolidation and the breakout occurred with increased volume, which is positive.

2. Buy Range:
With the identified buy point at $94, the standard buy range would extend to approximately $98.70 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (97 Composite Rating, 92 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $96.96, the stock is within the proper buy range from its breakout point and not extended.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is very close to its 52-week high, showing only 2.1% off its high, which is confirmed by both charts and fundamental metrics.

Additional Observations:
- Strong relative strength (RS Rating: 92)
- Healthy volume patterns
- Upward trending 50-day moving average
- Strong institutional support (Accumulation/Distribution Rating: B)

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 94.00,
    "buy_range_min": 94.00,
    "buy_range_max": 98.70,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- Buy point determined from the recent flat base breakout
- Buy range calculated as 5% above the buy point
- Position size recommendation based on strong fundamentals but acknowledging market risks
- Stock is not extended as it's trading within the proper buy range
- Confirmed near high status based on the 2.1% distance from 52-week high

The stock shows strong technical and fundamental characteristics that align well with CAN SLIM criteria, making it a potentially attractive candidate for investment within the specified buy range.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the daily chart, the stock has recently formed what appears to be a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point around $20.50. This is visible in the recent consolidation after the strong upward movement.

2. Buy Range: Given the identified buy point of $20.50, a reasonable buy range would extend to approximately $21.52 (5% above the buy point).

3. Position Size: Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 97 RS Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows both promise and risk.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $21.23, the stock is within the buy range from its latest buy point, so it's not extended.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 15.5% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not immediately near its high, though it has been showing strength in recent weeks.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 20.50,
    "buy_range_min": 20.50,
    "buy_range_max": 21.52,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with an A Accumulation/Distribution Rating
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing accumulation on up days
- The relative strength line is trending upward, confirming price strength
- The stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a strong technical position
- The high Composite Rating (99) and RS Rating (97) support the technical setup

The combination of strong fundamentals and technical patterns suggests this could be a viable CAN SLIM candidate, though proper risk management should be employed given the stock's volatility.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the NVIDIA (NVDA) stock charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The most recent buy point was at $145 from a handle-like pattern, as shown in the daily chart. This breakout occurred with strong volume and led to a significant upward move. The stock has formed several constructive bases throughout the period shown.

2. Buy Range: Based on the most recent pattern, the buy range would extend from $145 (buy point) to approximately $152.25 (5% above buy point). However, the stock is currently trading above this range at $173.72.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's high Composite Rating (99) and strong fundamental metrics, but also considering its relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's recent price action shows some volatility but controlled movements along its upward trend.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $173.72, the stock is extended from its most recent buy point of $145. It's trading approximately 19.8% above that level, which is well beyond the standard 5% buy range.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is only 5.2% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength and market leadership. This is confirmed by the high RS Rating of 94.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 145.00,
    "buy_range_min": 145.00,
    "buy_range_max": 152.25,
    "position_size": "moderate (5-7% of portfolio)",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows excellent fundamental metrics with a 99 Composite Rating and EPS Rating
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The stock is maintaining its position above key moving averages
- Current price action suggests waiting for a new base to form before considering new positions
- The high SMR Rating of A supports the stock's technical strength

Given the extended status from its buy point, investors should wait for a new base to form before considering new positions, despite the strong fundamental and technical metrics.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect and provide my technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent significant one at $133.40. The stock formed a handle-like pattern and broke out with increased volume, which is a positive technical signal. The current price action shows the stock trading above this level.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the buy point at $133.40, the traditional buy range would extend 5% above this level to approximately $140.07. However, the stock has already moved beyond this range.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 98 EPS Rating, 99 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently trading at $154.27, which is well above the last proper buy point of $133.40, putting it in extended territory.

5. Proximity to High:
According to the metrics, the stock is only 4.1% off its 52-week high, indicating it's very near its high.

Here's my technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 133.40,
    "buy_range_min": 133.40,
    "buy_range_max": 140.07,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is clearly defined by the recent breakout at $133.40
- The buy range follows the standard 5% rule from the buy point
- Position size is conservative due to volatility but accounts for strong fundamentals
- The stock is extended because it's trading more than 5% above the buy point
- It's near its high as confirmed by the 4.1% off 52-week high metric

Note: Given the extended status, investors might want to wait for a pullback to a support level or the formation of a new base before initiating a new position.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a clear buy point at $66.91, which formed from a cup-with-handle pattern. This is marked on the chart and represents a proper technical breakout point. There were also earlier entry points at $21.54 and $24.06, but those are no longer relevant for current analysis.

2. Buy Range: Using the standard 5% rule from the $66.91 buy point, the buy range would be $66.91 to $70.26. However, the stock has already moved well beyond this range.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's high volatility (as shown by the wide price swings) and strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows both high potential and higher risk.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $99.90, which is significantly above the last proper buy point of $66.91. This puts it approximately 49% above the buy point, making it clearly extended.

5. Proximity to High: At $99.90, the stock is 11.9% off its 52-week high (as provided in the metrics). The recent price action shows a pullback from recent highs around $110-115.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 66.91,
    "buy_range_min": 66.91,
    "buy_range_max": 70.26,
    "position_size": "15-20% of portfolio maximum",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock has strong fundamentals with a 99 Composite Rating and RS Rating
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional support
- The stock is currently pulling back but maintaining above its 50-day moving average
- Upcoming Q2 earnings (noted on chart) could increase volatility
- The stock has shown the ability to make strong moves after breakouts, as evidenced by the move from $66.91 to recent highs

Current recommendation would be to wait for a new proper base to form before considering a new position, as the stock is too extended from its last proper buy point.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent significant one at $144.27. This formed from a handle pattern with a prior entry at $124.67. The stock has shown strong technical action with multiple successful breakouts.

2. Buy Range: Given the current price of $194.74 and the most recent pattern, calculating a proper buy range would be based on the latest consolidation. However, the stock appears to be extended from its last proper buy point.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but current extended status, a more conservative position size would be prudent. 

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently extended from its last proper buy point at $144.27. It's trading approximately 35% above that level, well beyond the standard 5% buy zone.

5. Proximity to High: At $194.74, the stock is only 9.2% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength (confirmed by the 98 RS Rating).

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 144.27,
    "buy_range_min": 144.27,
    "buy_range_max": 151.48,
    "position_size": "Half normal size (2.5-5% of portfolio)",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is clearly defined at $144.27 from a proper handle formation
- The buy range extends 5% above the buy point ($144.27 to $151.48)
- Position size is reduced due to extended status
- Stock is clearly extended beyond its proper buy point
- Trading near its highs with strong relative strength

Given the extended nature of the stock, investors should wait for a new proper base to form before considering new positions. The strong fundamentals and technical performance suggest watching for potential pullbacks to support levels or new base formations.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a clear buy point at $95.21, which was established during a breakout. This is annotated directly on the chart and represents a valid technical entry point based on CAN SLIM principles.

2. Buy Range: Based on the $95.21 buy point, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, which would be approximately $99.97 (also noted on the chart).

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 82 EPS Rating, 97 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility as seen in the price swings, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $131.10, the stock is significantly extended from its last proper buy point of $95.21 (approximately 37% above).

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 11.1% off its 52-week high, showing some recent weakness but still maintaining a strong overall technical position.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 95.21,
    "buy_range_min": 95.21,
    "buy_range_max": 99.97,
    "position_size": "15-20% of portfolio maximum",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is clearly defined on the chart at $95.21
- The buy range follows the standard CAN SLIM 5% rule from the buy point
- Position size recommendation considers the strong fundamentals but accounts for volatility
- The stock is extended because it's trading well above (>5%) its proper buy point
- Despite being 11.1% off highs, it's still maintaining a strong technical position with support at moving averages

Current investors should be cautious about new purchases at these levels since the stock is extended from its proper buy point. Waiting for a new base formation or pullback to support levels might offer better entry opportunities.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: Looking at the weekly chart, there was a breakout from a consolidation pattern around $330-340. The stock has recently made a strong upward move and is currently trading at $401.80.

2. Buy Range: Given the current price action and the recent breakout, the stock appears to be extended from its last proper buy point. The previous consolidation breakout would have had a buy range of approximately $330-347.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's high volatility (as evidenced by the recent sharp price movements) and the current extended status, a smaller position size would be prudent if initiating a new position.

4. Extended Status: The stock is clearly extended from its last proper buy point, having moved up sharply from the $330 level to over $400.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently at or very near its 52-week high, as indicated by the "% Off 52-Week High: 0.2%" metric.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 330,
    "buy_range_min": 330,
    "buy_range_max": 347,
    "position_size": "15-20%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is set at $330 based on the visible consolidation pattern breakout
- Buy range is calculated as 5% above the buy point ($330 + 5% = $347)
- Position size is suggested at 15-20% due to high volatility and extended status
- The stock is clearly extended, trading well above the buy point
- It's near its high as confirmed by the fundamental metrics

Additional Considerations:
- Strong RS Rating of 94 indicates excellent relative strength
- High volume on recent moves supports the price action
- The stock shows strong institutional support based on the accumulation metrics
- Traders should wait for a new base to form before considering new positions at current levels</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a clear cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $34.77. This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with the handle forming a proper shakeout before the breakout.

2. Buy Range: Given the buy point of $34.77, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, making the upper limit approximately $36.51.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 98 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility as shown in the price swings, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $53.75, which is significantly above the initial buy point of $34.77. This puts it well beyond the 5% buy range, making it extended from its proper buy point.

5. Proximity to High: At $53.75, the stock is only 7.1% off its 52-week high, indicating it's relatively near its high. The chart shows strong momentum with healthy volume patterns.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 34.77,
    "buy_range_min": 34.77,
    "buy_range_max": 36.51,
    "position_size": "15-20%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock has shown exceptional relative strength (RS Rating: 98)
- Volume patterns support the breakout, showing institutional support
- The current price action shows strong momentum but is extended from the optimal buy point
- The stock has formed a profit-taking zone at around $43.46 (25% above entry)
- Investors should wait for a new base to form or a pullback to support levels before considering new positions

The analysis suggests waiting for a new base formation or pullback before initiating new positions, as the stock is currently extended from its proper buy point.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a clear buy point at $235.28, which formed from a cup-with-handle pattern. This is marked on the chart and represents a technically sound entry point.

2. Buy Range: Given the buy point of $235.28, a standard 5% buy range would extend to $247.04. This range is noted on the chart and provides a reasonable zone for entry.

3. Position Size: Given the strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) and relatively stable price action, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be justified. However, the current volatility suggests a more conservative approach.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $288.64, the stock is clearly extended from its $235.28 buy point (more than 20% above). This suggests caution for new entries at current levels.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is only 6% off its 52-week high, showing strong relative strength. The RS Rating of 95 confirms this technical strength.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 235.28,
    "buy_range_min": 235.28,
    "buy_range_max": 247.04,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with an A SMR Rating
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing accumulation
- The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, indicating strong momentum
- Current consolidation appears to be a normal pause after a strong advance
- The weekly chart shows a longer-term uptrend with proper base formations

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide my technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
From the weekly chart, I can identify a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $51.33 (marked on the chart). The stock has already broken out from this pattern and moved significantly higher.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
Given the current price of $72.93 and the identified buy point of $51.33, the stock is well beyond the typical 5% buy range from the original breakout point.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's high volatility (as seen in recent price swings) and strong fundamental ratings (99 Composite Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently extended from its proper buy point at $51.33. It's trading approximately 42% above that level, well beyond the standard 5% buy range.

5. Proximity to High:
According to the metrics provided, the stock is only 9.2% off its 52-week high, indicating it's relatively near its high.

Here's the formatted output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 51.33,
    "buy_range_min": 51.33,
    "buy_range_max": 53.90,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong technical and fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating)
- The current price action shows some pullback from recent highs
- Volume patterns support the original breakout
- The stock is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages
- Given the extended status, investors should wait for a new proper base to form before considering new positions</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a previous buy point at $401.98, which was a breakout point. The stock has moved significantly higher since then and appears to be in an uptrend, forming what looks like a new base pattern.

2. Buy Range: Given the current price action and the fact that the stock is trading near all-time highs, it's difficult to establish a new buy range until a new base pattern completes. The previous buy range would have been $401.98 to approximately $422 (5% above the buy point).

3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 98 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be appropriate for aggressive investors.

4. Extended Status: The stock is currently extended from its last proper buy point at $401.98. It has moved significantly higher and needs to form a new base before presenting a new buying opportunity.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is very close to its 52-week high, trading only 6.4% below it. The strong RS Rating of 94 confirms the relative strength.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 401.98,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Explanations:
- Buy point and range are null for new entries because the stock is extended and needs to form a new base
- Position size recommendation of 7-8% is based on strong fundamentals and institutional quality metrics
- The stock is clearly extended from its last proper buy point
- The stock is near its high, confirmed by the 6.4% off 52-week high metric
- The strong RS line and high RS Rating (94) suggest continued institutional support

The stock shows excellent fundamental and technical characteristics but would need to form a new base before presenting a new buying opportunity. Investors should wait for a new proper entry point to emerge.</p>

Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA) rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Shopify (SHOP) headline another big week of earnings reports. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) reported a 4% operating profit decline on Saturday due to currency impacts tied to the conglomerate's non-U.S. dollar debt. The stock market rally suffered its worst week in months. The indexes broke or tested key levels in Friday's sell-off amid new Trump tariffs and a weak jobs report. Investors may have wanted to cut some stocks and overall exposure Friday. Have a game plan ready for Monday. AMD earnings Tuesday night will be key for AI demand broadly, especially with Arista Networks (ANET), Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB) also set to report. AI hardware and related sectors had been doing well until late last week, buoyed by strong capital spending forecasts by the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

President Donald Trump imposed new tariff rates for dozens of countries, effective Aug. 7. A weak jobs report Friday revived Fed rate hopes, but also raised concerns about the economy, especially with core inflation also picking up. President Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following the job reports, claiming partisan bias. The move, widely criticized, may undermine faith in economic data going forward. Earnings were mixed during the week, with Meta among the many winners while fellow titan Amazon (AMZN) was a notable loser. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.9% in last week's stock market trading, testing its 50-day moving average on Friday. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively, both undercutting their 21-day moving averages. The small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 4.2%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day lines. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) lost 3.3%, but closed above its 50-day line. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) shed 3.7%, finishing below the 50-day. Arguably the market was due for a pullback. Will the Nasdaq and S&P 500 find their footing or drop down to their 50-day lines, while other indexes and ETFs break decisively below that key level? The 10-year Treasury yield dived 17 basis points to 4.22%, with nearly all of that decline coming Friday. The two-year Treasury yield, more closely tied to Fed policy, tumbled 21 basis points to 3.7%, including 25 basis points on Friday, to a three-month low. U.S. crude oil futures rose 3.3% to $67.33 a barrel, despite sliding 2.8% on Friday.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slumped 3.6%, even with Microsoft stock a big holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slipped 1.2%, with AMD stock a big SMH holding. ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) dived 7.3% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) plunged 9.5%. Shopify stock and AMD are top-10 holdings across ARK Invest's ETFs. SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) slumped 6.7%, breaking a long weekly win streak. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) slipped 2.6%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) declined 1.7% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) retreated 3.9%. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) fell back 3.4%. The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dropped 3.8%.\n\nAfter rising steadily over the prior month, and strongly since early April, the stock market had a bad Friday to cap a tough week. Investors may have needed to cut some stocks late last week because they were losers or round-tripping gains. Simply trimming exposure also made sense When the market is falling, it's not easy to decide whether to sell down positions or to be patient. Having sell rules and a game plan ahead of time helps keep the emotions out. The key isn't to be right every time, but to find a strategy that works for you in terms of protecting your portfolio vs. riding winners for the long term. When the market is falling, see which stocks hold up the best and are first to rebound. These could be names to focus on if and when the market bounces. Palantir headlines earnings Monday night, AMD (plus Super Micro and Arista Networks) will be focus late Tuesday, withe Shopify early Wednesday. Investors also will get results from DoorDash (DASH), Fortinet (FTNT), Hims & Hers Health (HIMS), MercadoLibre (MELI), Caterpillar (CAT), Toast (TOST), Sezzle (SEZL), Twilio (TWLO), Disney (DIS), Constellation Energy (CEG), Vistra (VST) and Rocket Lab (RKLB), along with many more.

Even recent highflier Nvidia (NVDA) couldn't save the Dow Jones index on the stock market today. The Dow finished with a loss of 1.2%, or 542 points. But the gauge of blue-chips had lost more than 600 points during the first trading day of August. The S&P 500 skidded 1.6% lower, making it four straight days of losses. The Nasdaq composite was hit the hardest among large-cap stock trackers. It stumbled 2.2%, sinking well below the 21,000 level. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq tested their 21-day exponential moving averages Friday. Each index also hit new intraday highs Thursday, but finished lower that day. President Donald Trump was clearly unhappy with the July jobs report released Friday. He instructed a team to oust the head Bureau of Labor Statistics after the weak monthly numbers. The small-cap Russell 2000 index sank 2%, but closed off the day's lows. The Russell 2000 extended its losing streak to five straight sessions. It fell below its 200-day moving average and closed on its 50-day moving average. Losers squashed winners on the Nasdaq exchange by nearly 3-to-1. The ratio was around 12-5 negative on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq compared with Thursday, in preliminary numbers.\n\nIn other news out of Washington, Federal Reserve Gov. Adriana Kugler is resigning, the central bank said. Kugler is part of the Federal Open Market Committee that sets interest rates. Her departure is effective Aug. 8. Stock Market Today: This Power Stock Leads The S&P 500 Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) stood out with its roughly 12% gain on the stock market today. Shares popped after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit and revenue. It also issued third-quarter sales guidance topping views. Shares bounced off their 50-day line and blew past the previous 755 flat base buy point. It was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 Friday. LPL Financial Holdings (LPLA) sank 7.5% even after brokerage and financial advisory provider beat second-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Shares fell below their 50-day line and beyond the 7% loss area, triggering a sell signal. What To Do After Market Sell-Off. Palantir, AMD Lead Big Earnings"

Strong institutional metrics (RS 97, Composite 98)\n\n### Key Concerns:\n1. Stock is extended from prior bases\n2. Handle needs proper formation and depth (8-12% ideal)\n3. Volume needs to expand on eventual breakout\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Monitor handle formation\n2. Wait for proper entry point development\n3. Look for volume confirmation on breakout\n4. Consider smaller position due to extended nature\n\nThe pattern quality is good but requires patience for proper handle completion before considering entry.

Pattern Quality Notes\n- Positives:\n  * Strong prior uptrend\n  * Tight price action\n  * Good volume pattern\n- Concerns:\n  * Handle slightly longer than ideal\n  * Some volatility in recent price action\n\nThis is a solid B-grade setup with clear parameters for entry and risk management. The key is waiting for the proper breakout volume confirmation above $181.35.",

Buy Point: The most recent buy point was at $145 from a handle-like pattern, as shown in the daily chart. This breakout occurred with strong volume and led to a significant upward move. The stock has formed several constructive bases throughout the period shown.\n\n2. Buy Range: Based on the most recent pattern, the buy range would extend from $145 (buy point) to approximately $152.25 (5% above buy point). However, the stock is currently trading above this range at $173.72.\n\n3. Position Size: Given the stock's high Composite Rating (99) and strong fundamental metrics, but also considering its relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's recent price action shows some volatility but controlled movements along its upward trend.\n\n4. Extended Status: At the current price of $173.72, the stock is extended from its most recent buy point of $145. It's trading approximately 19.8% above that level, which is well beyond the standard 5% buy range.\n\n5.

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent significant one at $133.40. The stock formed a handle-like pattern and broke out with increased volume, which is a positive technical signal. The current price action shows the stock trading above this level.\n\n2. Buy Range Analysis:\nWith the buy point at $133.40, the traditional buy range would extend 5% above this level to approximately $140.07. However, the stock has already moved beyond this range.\n\n3. Position Size Consideration:\nGiven the strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 98 EPS Rating, 99 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is currently trading at $154.27, which is well above the last proper buy point of $133.40, putting it in extended territory.\n\n5.

Previous buy points were at $165.33 and $164.10, which are now well below current levels.\n\n2. Buy Range: With the most recent buy point at $246.60, the buy range would typically extend 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at approximately $258.93. However, the stock has pulled back from this level.\n\n3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but considering current market volatility and the -8.05% recent decline, a moderate position size would be appropriate.\n\n4. Extended Status: The stock is currently NOT extended from its buy point. In fact, it has pulled back below the buy point of $246.60 to $225.27, putting it in a potential support zone.\n\n5.

There were also earlier entry points at $21.54 and $24.06, but those are no longer relevant for current analysis.\n\n2.

Position Size: Given the stock's high volatility (as shown by the wide price swings) and strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate.

Buy Range: Given the buy point of $108.31, the buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, making the maximum buy range $113.73.\n\n3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but considering its relatively high volatility as shown in the charts, a moderate position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate.\n\n4. Extended Status: The stock is currently trading at $104.31, which is below the identified buy point. Therefore, it is not extended.\n\n5.

The pattern shows proper depth and duration, with strong relative strength throughout the base formation.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nWith a buy point of $63.90, the maximum buy range would extend to approximately $67.10 (5% above the buy point). The current price of $63.61 is actually slightly below the buy point, suggesting the stock hasn't broken out yet.\n\n3.

The stock's presence in the IBD 50 and strong RS rating of 95 support this sizing recommendation.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is not currently extended from its buy point.

Buy Point Analysis:\nLooking at the weekly chart, there appears to be a series of base formations with clear buy points marked. The most recent significant buy point was around $265.82, but the stock has moved significantly higher since then.\n\n2. Buy Range Analysis:\nThe stock is currently trading at $395.17, which is well above the last major buy point. No current proper buy range can be established as the stock needs to form a new base pattern.\n\n3. Position Size Consideration:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (97 Composite Rating, 98 EPS Rating) but current extended status, a conservative position size would be prudent.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is currently extended from its last proper buy point and would need to form a new base before presenting a new buying opportunity.\n\n5. Proximity to High:\nThe stock is currently 7% off its 52-week high, showing relative strength while maintaining a healthy consolidation pattern.\n\nHere's my technical analysis output:\n\n{\n  \"technical_data\": {\n    \"buy_point\": null,\n    \"buy_range_min\": null,\n    \"buy_range_max\": null,\n    \"position_size\": \"15-20%\",\n    \"is_extended\": true,\n    \"near_high\": true\n  }\n}\n\nReasoning:\n- Buy Point & Range: Nulls because the stock is extended and needs to form a new base pattern before establishing new buy points.\n- Position Size: Suggested 15-20% based on strong fundamentals (97 Composite Rating) but considering current market conditions and extended status.\n- Extended Status: True because the stock is well above its last proper buy point.\n- Near High: True as it's only 7% off its 52-week high with strong relative strength (RS Rating 91).\n\nThe stock shows strong fundamental and technical characteristics but would need to form a new base pattern before presenting a new buying opportunity.

Buy Range:\nGiven the current price of $125.03 and the recent volatility, a reasonable buy range would be between $120 (the breakout point) and $126 (5% above breakout).\n\n3.

Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (Composite Rating: 96, RS Rating: 97) but relatively high volatility as seen in the price action, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

The stock shows strong institutional support with a B+ accumulation rating.\n\n4. Extended Status: At the current price of $27.09, the stock is significantly extended from its $16.40 buy point (approximately 65% above). This indicates it's well beyond the standard 5% buy range.\n\n5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 15.2% off its 52-week high, showing some recent pullback but still maintaining a strong overall uptrend.\n\nHere's the formatted output:\n\n{\n  \"technical_data\": {\n    \"buy_point\": 16.40,\n    \"buy_range_min\": 16.40,\n    \"buy_range_max\": 17.22,\n    \"position_size\": \"moderate - 5-7% of portfolio\",\n    \"is_extended\": true,\n    \"near_high\": false\n  }\n}\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The stock shows exceptional relative strength with a 99 RS Rating\n- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support\n- The current pullback might offer a potential secondary entry point if it forms a proper base\n- The high EPS and sales growth (999% and 523% respectively) support the technical strength\n- The stock is part of the IBD 50, indicating strong overall fundamentals and technical merit\n\nCurrent recommendation would be to wait for a new proper base to form given the extended status from the original buy point.",

This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with strong volume confirmation during the breakout.\n\n2. Buy Range: Following CAN SLIM principles, the buy range would extend 5% above the buy point of $291.69. Therefore, the buy range would be from $291.69 to $306.27.\n\n3. Position Size: Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 97 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate. This recommendation considers the stock's strong technical and fundamental characteristics while maintaining prudent risk management.\n\n4.

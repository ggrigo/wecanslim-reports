                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $126.78. The stock has recently broken out of this pattern with good volume confirmation. The handle formation is technically sound, showing proper depth and duration.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the buy point at $126.78, a standard 5% buy range would extend to $133.12. However, given the current price of $125.22, the stock is actually slightly below the ideal buy point.

3. Position Size:
Given the strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 97 EPS Rating) and relatively controlled volatility shown in the chart, a moderate to slightly aggressive position size could be warranted. The stock's presence in the IBD 50 also supports this.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended from its buy point - in fact, it's trading slightly below the ideal entry point of $126.78.

5. Proximity to High:
At $125.22 and only 3.5% off its 52-week high, the stock is showing relative strength and is indeed near its highs.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 126.78,
    "buy_range_min": 126.78,
    "buy_range_max": 133.12,
    "position_size": "8-12% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support based on the volume patterns
- The RS line (blue) is showing strength, confirming the breakout attempt
- The base formation is technically sound with proper depth and time requirements
- Volume characteristics are supportive of the recent price action
- The fundamental metrics (particularly the 99 Composite Rating and 97 EPS Rating) support the technical setup

The stock appears to be setting up for a potential breakout, with strong technical and fundamental characteristics aligning. The current price sitting slightly below the buy point could present an opportunity for investors following the CAN SLIM methodology.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics for StoneX Group (SNEX), here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to be in an uptrend, trading near its all-time highs. Looking at the daily and weekly charts, the stock has recently broken out of a flat base pattern around the $94-95 level. The buy point can be established at $95.20, which represents the breakout point from this consolidation pattern.

2. Buy Range:
With the identified buy point at $95.20, a standard 5% buy range would extend to $99.96. The current price of $96.96 falls within this buy range.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (Composite Rating: 97, EPS Rating: 92) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate. This recommendation is based on the stock's solid technical pattern and strong institutional support as evidenced by the volume patterns.

4. Extended Status:
At $96.96, the stock is approximately 1.8% above the buy point of $95.20, which means it is not extended from its proper buy point (would need to be >5% to be considered extended).

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is very near its high, being only 2.1% off its 52-week high according to the fundamental metrics provided. This confirms strong momentum but also suggests careful entry point selection.

Here's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 95.20,
    "buy_range_min": 95.20,
    "buy_range_max": 99.96,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 92)
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages
- The overall market trend and industry group performance support this setup
- The flat base pattern provides a lower-risk entry point compared to more volatile patterns

These determinations are based on classical CAN SLIM technical analysis principles and the visible chart patterns in both daily and weekly timeframes.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
Looking at the charts, the stock has formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point around $375. The stock is currently trading at $367.78, slightly below this potential buy point. The pattern shows healthy consolidation and proper depth (not too deep), which is positive.

2. Buy Range:
With a buy point of $375, the buy range would extend to approximately $393.75 (5% above buy point). However, given the stock's current position and volatility, a more conservative buy range would be $375-$390.

3. Position Size:
Given the strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 84 EPS Rating, 96 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's P/E ratio of 92.18 suggests higher risk.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended from its buy point - in fact, it's still below the potential buy point of $375.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is 11% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics, suggesting it's not immediately near its high but still in a relatively strong position.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 375.00,
    "buy_range_min": 375.00,
    "buy_range_max": 390.00,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS 96)
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The current pullback appears normal within the context of the broader pattern
- The stock maintains position above key moving averages, indicating overall technical strength
- Risk is elevated due to high P/E ratio and market volatility, hence the conservative position size recommendation

The analysis suggests waiting for confirmation of a breakout above $375 with strong volume before entering a position.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a recent breakout at $248.74 from a three-weeks-tight pattern. Prior to this, there were several key entry points including $207.23 and $181.78. The current pattern appears to be a valid continuation pattern following an uptrend.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the breakout point at $248.74, a standard 5% buy range would extend to approximately $261.18. However, given the current price at $248.35, the stock is trading right at the breakout level.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's high Composite Rating (99) and RS Rating (94), but considering the elevated volatility and high P/E ratio (322.53), a moderate position size would be prudent.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended from its buy point, as it's trading right at the breakout level of the three-weeks-tight pattern.

5. Proximity to High:
At $248.35, the stock is only 2% off its 52-week high, indicating strong momentum but also potential resistance levels nearby.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 248.74,
    "buy_range_min": 248.74,
    "buy_range_max": 261.18,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 94)
- Volume is running below average (-23%), which warrants caution
- The three-weeks-tight pattern suggests institutional accumulation
- Strong uptrend supported by both 50-day and 200-day moving averages
- High Composite Rating (99) supports the technical setup
- Consider using half positions due to market conditions and high P/E ratio</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a recent cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $254.87. There's also a more recent breakout from a flat base with a buy point around $288.52. The stock has shown strong technical action with support at the 21-day exponential moving average.

2. Buy Range:
Given the recent breakout at $288.52, the buy range would extend to approximately $302.95 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size:
With strong fundamentals (89 Composite Rating, 89 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a standard position size could be justified. However, the -11% sales growth is a concern.

4. Extended Status:
At $289.37, the stock is just barely above its recent buy point of $288.52, so it's not extended from this entry.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is only 4% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength and market leadership.

Here's the technical data in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 288.52,
    "buy_range_min": 288.52,
    "buy_range_max": 302.95,
    "position_size": "half",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- Buy point is clearly defined by the recent flat base breakout
- Buy range extends 5% above the buy point
- Recommending half position due to mixed fundamentals (strong earnings but weak sales growth)
- Stock is not extended as it's trading within the proper buy range
- Proximity to high is confirmed by the 4% off 52-week high metric

The stock shows strong technical action but investors should monitor the sales growth weakness as a potential risk factor.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent significant one being at $67.37. The stock has formed what appears to be a cup-with-handle pattern, with strong fundamental metrics supporting the technical setup (99 Composite Rating, 98 RS Rating).

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the identified buy point at $67.37, the traditional buy range would extend approximately 5% above this level, putting the upper limit at around $70.74. However, the stock is currently trading at $62.55, below the buy point.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong ratings (99 Composite, 81 EPS, 98 RS) but relatively high volatility as shown in the chart patterns, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's high P/E ratio of 145.47 also suggests some additional risk.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended - in fact, it's trading below the recent buy point at $67.37. It's showing a 14.3% decline from its 52-week high.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently about 14.3% off its 52-week high, indicating it's in a pullback phase rather than near its high.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 67.37,
    "buy_range_min": 67.37,
    "buy_range_max": 70.74,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point of $67.37 is clearly visible on the chart and represents a recent significant breakout level
- The buy range extends 5% above the buy point ($67.37 to $70.74)
- Position size recommendation considers the strong ratings but high P/E ratio and volatility
- The stock is not extended as it's trading below the buy point
- Currently in a pullback phase, not near its high
- The strong fundamental metrics (especially the 99 Composite Rating and 98 RS Rating) support the technical setup</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a clear buy point at $246.60, which formed from a cup-with-handle pattern. This is marked on the chart and represents a legitimate breakout point with increased volume.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
Using the standard 5% rule from the buy point of $246.60:
- Buy range minimum: $246.60
- Buy range maximum: $258.93 (246.60 * 1.05)

3. Position Size:
Given the strong fundamental metrics (98 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) and relatively controlled volatility, a position size of "Medium" (12-15% of portfolio) could be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently at $225.27, which is actually below the buy point of $246.60, so it is not extended. In fact, it has pulled back from its recent high.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is 11.2% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the metrics. This represents a moderate pullback from peak levels.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 246.60,
    "buy_range_min": 246.60,
    "buy_range_max": 258.93,
    "position_size": "12-15%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Analysis:
- The stock shows strong relative strength with a 97 RS Rating
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The current pullback might present a potential buying opportunity if the stock can recover and break out above the identified buy point
- The stock has strong fundamental metrics supporting the technical pattern
- The 50-day moving average appears to be acting as support, which is positive for the technical structure</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics, here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a recent breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $15.82. The stock has shown strong relative strength (RS Rating: 97) and good volume characteristics during the breakout attempt.

2. Buy Range Determination:
With the identified buy point at $15.82, the standard buy range would extend up to approximately 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at around $16.61.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and the current market conditions, a conservative position size of 5-7% of the portfolio would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently not extended from its buy point. In fact, it has pulled back below the buy point, currently trading at $15.40.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 28.5% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not near its high levels.

Here's the formatted output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 15.82,
    "buy_range_min": 15.82,
    "buy_range_max": 16.61,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamental ratings (Composite Rating: 96)
- The high RS Rating of 97 is particularly positive
- The recent pullback might offer a secondary buying opportunity if the stock can regain its buy point with strong volume
- The SMR Rating of C suggests some caution regarding the company's sales, margins, and ROE metrics
- The high sales growth (172%) is notable but should be viewed in context with the other metrics

The current setup suggests watching for a potential reversal back above the buy point with strong volume before considering entry.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
The stock appears to have recently broken out of a consolidation pattern around $20, but has pulled back. The most recent potential buy point would have been around $20 when it cleared the previous resistance level. However, given the current downward movement and violation of moving averages, this is no longer valid.

2. Buy Range:
With the stock currently showing weakness and trading below key moving averages, it's not currently presenting a proper buy setup. Therefore, we cannot establish a valid buy range at this time.

3. Position Size:
Given the high volatility shown in the charts (with swings of over 30%) and the poor EPS rating of 43, this would suggest a more conservative position size if entering a position.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended - in fact, it's pulling back and is currently 30.8% off its 52-week high.

5. Proximity to High:
With the stock being 30.8% off its 52-week high and showing recent weakness, it is not near its high.

Additional Observations:
- Strong RS Rating of 98 shows excellent relative strength
- Poor EPS Rating of 43 is concerning from a CAN SLIM perspective
- The stock is showing increasing volume on down days, which is a warning sign
- Current price action is below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "small (max 5% of portfolio)",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

The buy point and buy range are set to null because the stock is not currently showing a proper technical setup for entry. The poor earnings metrics combined with the current technical weakness suggest waiting for a new proper base to form before considering entry.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics for Amphenol (APH), here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to have recently broken out of a cup-with-handle pattern, with a buy point around $100. The pattern formed over several months and shows healthy price and volume characteristics.

2. Buy Range Assessment:
Given the current price of $104.31 and the identified buy point around $100, we can establish a buy range of approximately $100-$105.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently trading about 4% above the buy point, which means it's not yet extended (>5% above buy point).

5. Proximity to High:
With only 4.2% off its 52-week high and showing strong momentum, the stock is indeed near its high.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 100.00,
    "buy_range_min": 100.00,
    "buy_range_max": 105.00,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Analysis Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 94)
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The 50-day moving average is trending upward, providing support
- The stock has maintained its uptrend while staying above key moving averages
- The SMR Rating of A supports the technical strength shown in the charts

The combination of strong technical and fundamental metrics suggests this stock is in a favorable position for consideration, though investors should be mindful of the current market conditions and maintain proper risk management protocols.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect and provide my technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a clear buy point at $73.34, which formed from a cup-with-handle pattern. This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with confirmation from increased volume at the breakout point.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the buy point at $73.34, a standard 5% buy range would extend to $77.01. However, the stock is currently trading at $66.41, well below the buy point.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and the strong fundamentals (Composite Rating: 91, RS Rating: 95), a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended - it's actually trading below its recent buy point at $73.34. Currently at $66.41, it's in a pullback phase.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is 19.5% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not currently near its high point.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 73.34,
    "buy_range_min": 73.34,
    "buy_range_max": 77.01,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Analysis:
- The stock shows strong relative strength with an RS Rating of 95
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The stock is currently finding support at its 50-day moving average
- The current pullback might present a secondary buying opportunity if the stock can show strength and volume on a move back up

The stock's technical picture, combined with strong fundamental ratings (especially the 91 Composite Rating), suggests this could be a viable CAN SLIM candidate once it returns to a proper buy point or forms a new base.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect carefully:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to be forming a flat base pattern with resistance around $103.81. The current consolidation shows a potential buy point emerging from this flat base formation. Based on the daily chart, there's a clear resistance level that would serve as the buy point at $103.81.

2. Buy Range:
With the identified buy point at $103.81, a standard 5% buy range would extend from the buy point up to approximately $109.00.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's metrics (high Composite Rating of 98, strong RS Rating of 97, but higher volatility as shown in the charts and a C SMR rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows both strength and risk factors.

4. Extended Status:
Currently at $101.60, the stock is not extended from its potential buy point of $103.81. In fact, it's still below the buy point.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 13.7% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics, suggesting it's not immediately near its high but showing recovery momentum.

Here's the technical analysis output in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 103.81,
    "buy_range_min": 103.81,
    "buy_range_max": 109.00,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 97) which is positive
- The flat base pattern is relatively well-formed
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional support
- The C SMR Rating suggests some fundamental risks that warrant the more conservative position size recommendation
- The stock is showing constructive price action while building this base, which is positive for the potential breakout

The analysis suggests waiting for confirmation of the breakout above $103.81 before entering, with strict adherence to the buy range and position size recommendations to manage risk appropriately.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics, here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to be forming a cup-with-handle pattern, with a potential buy point around $54.50. The recent price action shows consolidation after a strong upward movement, with the stock currently trading at $56.64.

2. Buy Range:
Given the identified buy point of $54.50, a reasonable buy range would be between $54.50 and $57.23 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the daily chart) and strong fundamentals (96 Composite Rating), a moderate position size of 5-7% would be appropriate to balance opportunity with risk.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently trading approximately 4% above the suggested buy point, which means it's not yet technically extended (>5% above buy point).

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 14.8% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not near its high point. However, it's showing positive momentum with strong relative strength (RS Rating: 96).

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 54.50,
    "buy_range_min": 54.50,
    "buy_range_max": 57.23,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Key considerations:
- Strong RS Rating of 96 suggests excellent relative strength
- Composite Rating of 96 indicates overall strong fundamentals
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional support
- The stock is showing signs of potential breakout from a consolidation pattern
- Current price action suggests accumulation phase

Caution points:
- EPS growth is negative (-53.0%)
- Market volatility should be considered for position sizing
- The stock's current consolidation needs to be monitored for proper breakout confirmation</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze IBKR according to the CAN SLIM criteria:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
Looking at the weekly chart, there appears to be a cup-with-handle formation with a buy point around $61.50. The handle shows proper price contraction and the pattern formed over a reasonable timeframe.

2. Buy Range:
With a buy point of $61.50, a reasonable buy range would extend to approximately $64.57 (5% above buy point).

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 96 EPS Rating) but considering current market volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $63.61, the stock is trading within the buy range from the $61.50 buy point, so it's not extended.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is only 4.8% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength and momentum.

Here's the technical data in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 61.50,
    "buy_range_min": 61.50,
    "buy_range_max": 64.57,
    "position_size": "6-8% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is derived from the cup-with-handle pattern visible on the weekly chart
- Buy range extends 5% above the buy point, following standard CAN SLIM guidelines
- Position size recommendation considers the strong fundamentals but acknowledges market risk
- Stock is not extended as it's trading within the proper buy range
- The small 4.8% distance from 52-week high confirms strong market performance

The stock shows healthy technical action with strong fundamental metrics supporting the technical pattern.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect carefully:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to be in a strong uptrend but has recently pulled back. Looking at the weekly chart, there isn't a clear, current proper buy point forming in a traditional CAN SLIM base pattern. The stock is currently in a correction phase after a strong run-up.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
Without a proper base formation completed, we cannot establish a specific buy range at this time. The stock needs to form a proper base pattern first.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the high volatility (as seen in the recent price swings) and the poor fundamental metrics (EPS Rating of 19, SMR Rating of D), a conservative position size would be appropriate if entering a position.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not currently extended from a buy point as it's actually pulling back from recent highs.

5. Proximity to High:
According to the metrics, the stock is 17% off its 52-week high, so it's not currently near its high.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "small (max 5% of portfolio)",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Reasoning:
- Buy point and range are null because there's no proper base pattern currently forming
- Position size recommendation is conservative due to poor fundamentals and high volatility
- Stock is not extended as it's in a pullback phase
- Not near high as it's 17% off its 52-week high
- While the RS Rating is strong at 98, the poor EPS rating (19) and SMR Rating (D) suggest caution

The stock would need to form a proper base pattern and show improving fundamentals before considering a new entry point. The current technical action suggests a period of consolidation may be necessary.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics, here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to have formed a cup-with-handle pattern on the weekly chart, with a recent breakout around $70. The most recent buy point can be identified at approximately $70.50, which represents the handle's high point.

2. Buy Range:
Given the identified buy point of $70.50, a reasonable buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, putting the maximum buy range at approximately $74.00.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows some price swings but has strong institutional support.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $72.93, the stock is within the buy range from its breakout point and is not technically extended.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 9.2% off its 52-week high, showing it's relatively near its high but has pulled back somewhat.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 70.50,
    "buy_range_min": 70.50,
    "buy_range_max": 74.00,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 95)
- Volume patterns support the recent breakout
- The pullback from highs has been orderly, maintaining above key moving averages
- The strong fundamental metrics (especially the 373% EPS growth) support the technical setup
- The stock is part of the IBD 50, indicating institutional support

The current setup appears technically sound, though investors should be mindful of the general market conditions and maintain proper stop-loss levels.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase after a significant decline from its peak around $300. While there's a potential base forming, it hasn't yet established a clear buy point as the pattern is still developing. The current price action shows volatility and hasn't formed a clear cup-with-handle, double bottom, or flat base pattern.

2. Buy Range:
Given that a proper buy point hasn't been established yet, we cannot determine a specific buy range. The stock needs to complete a proper base formation first.

3. Position Size:
Given the high volatility (as evidenced by the wide price swings) and the relatively weak EPS rating (37), a conservative position size would be warranted. The high RS Rating (98) suggests strong price performance relative to the market.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended from a buy point. In fact, it's trading 44% below its 52-week high, indicating significant downside from previous levels.

5. Proximity to High:
With the stock trading at $168.10 and 44% off its 52-week high, it's clearly not near its high points.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": null,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "small (5-10% maximum)",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The high RS Rating (98) is positive, but the low EPS Rating (37) is concerning from a CAN SLIM perspective
- The stock shows high volatility, suggesting increased risk
- Current price action suggests the stock is still in a correction phase
- Investors should wait for a proper base formation and breakout before considering entry
- The high P/E ratio of 218.31 suggests premium valuation, requiring careful consideration

The null values for buy point and ranges reflect that the stock hasn't yet formed a proper technical entry point according to CAN SLIM methodology.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a previous buy point at $64.62 with a 5% buy zone up to $67.85. Currently, the stock is in a downtrend from its peak and hasn't formed a new proper buy point. The stock is trading at $104.14, significantly below its recent highs.

2. Buy Range:
Given the current technical situation with the stock in a downtrend, there isn't a valid buy range to identify at this time. The stock needs to form a new base pattern before establishing a new buy point and range.

3. Position Size:
Given the high volatility (as evidenced by the wide price swings), poor fundamentals (EPS Rating of 16), and current downtrend, this would be a high-risk position. The stock is showing high relative strength (RS 98) but poor earnings.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is not extended - it's actually well below its previous highs, trading 44% off its 52-week high.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is significantly below its highs, showing a clear downtrend on the chart.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

    "buy_point": null,

- Buy point is null because the stock is in a downtrend and hasn't formed a proper base pattern
- Buy range is null for the same reason - no valid setup currently exists
- Position size is set to "avoid" due to poor fundamentals (EPS 16) and current technical weakness
- Is_extended is false as the stock is well below previous highs
- Near_high is false as the stock is 44% off its 52-week high

The stock needs to form a proper base pattern and show improving fundamentals before considering a new entry point. The high RS Rating (98) is positive, but the poor EPS rating (16) and downtrend suggest waiting for better conditions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
Looking at the daily and weekly charts, the stock has recently broken out of a flat base pattern. The most recent buy point appears to be around $315, which was established when the stock cleared a short consolidation period. The stock is showing strong technical characteristics with both daily and weekly charts displaying healthy price action.

2. Buy Range:
With the identified buy point at $315, the standard buy range would extend to approximately $330.75 (5% above buy point). The current price of $325.09 is within this buy range.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 96 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be appropriate for aggressive investors. However, due to the stock's current position within its move, a more conservative 5% position might be prudent.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently trading about 3.2% above its recent buy point, which means it is not yet extended from a proper buy point (would need to be >5% above).

5. Proximity to High:
With only 1.1% off its 52-week high and showing strong relative strength (RS Rating: 90), the stock is indeed very close to its high.

Here's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 315.00,
    "buy_range_min": 315.00,
    "buy_range_max": 330.75,
    "position_size": "5%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows excellent relative strength with an RS Rating of 90
- Volume patterns are healthy, though showing some recent decline
- The stock is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages
- The base pattern is sound with proper depth and duration
- Strong institutional sponsorship is evident from the fundamental metrics

The analysis suggests this stock is currently in a technically favorable position, though investors should remain vigilant due to its proximity to highs and the general market conditions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and metrics for IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF), I'll perform a detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a cup-with-handle pattern with a recent breakout. The buy point appears to be at $61.75, which was confirmed with increased volume. A secondary buy point formed at $63.70.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the identified buy point at $61.75, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level:
- From $61.75 (buy point)
- To approximately $64.84 (5% above buy point)

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's:
- High RS Rating of 92
- Moderate volatility
- ETF structure (generally less volatile than individual stocks)
A moderate position size of 5-7% of the portfolio would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The current price of $64.22 is within the buy range from both the primary ($61.75) and secondary ($63.70) buy points, so it's not technically extended.

5. Proximity to High:
At $64.22, the stock is only 8% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength and momentum.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 61.75,
    "buy_range_min": 61.75,
    "buy_range_max": 64.84,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The strong RS Rating of 92 confirms the relative strength
- Volume patterns show healthy institutional support
- The ETF is showing constructive price action with a series of higher lows
- The current consolidation appears technically sound with proper depth and duration
- Price action is supported by the 50-day moving average, which is trending upward

These factors combine to present a relatively favorable technical setup, though investors should remain mindful of the broader market conditions and Bitcoin's inherent volatility.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect carefully:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to be in an uptrend, trading above its 50-day moving average. Looking at the recent price action, there appears to be a breakout from a flat base pattern around the $18.50 level. This would establish our primary buy point.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With a buy point at $18.50, the standard buy range would extend 5% above this level, putting the upper limit at approximately $19.42.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 96 RS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's current price action and volume patterns suggest a medium-risk setup.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $19.35, the stock is trading within the buy range from the $18.50 buy point, so it's not technically extended.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is very close to its highs, only 4.8% off its 52-week high according to the fundamental metrics provided.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 18.50,
    "buy_range_min": 18.50,
    "buy_range_max": 19.42,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support based on the volume patterns
- The RS line is making new highs, confirming the price strength
- The high Composite Rating (99) and RS Rating (96) support the technical setup
- The stock's volatility and trading patterns suggest maintaining strict sell rules and position size discipline
- The current market conditions and sector performance should be considered before making any final trading decisions</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect carefully:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to have formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a recent breakout. The most recent buy point appears to be around $115.37, which is visible on both daily and weekly charts. This corresponds to a breakout from a proper base formation.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the buy point at $115.37, a standard 5% buy range would extend to $121.14. The current price of $118.60 falls within this range.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (97 Composite Rating, 95 EPS Rating) but relatively high volatility as seen in the charts, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's presence in the IBD 50 adds confidence.

4. Extended Status:
At $118.60, the stock is approximately 2.8% above the $115.37 buy point, which means it is not extended (would need to be >5% above buy point to be considered extended).

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 8.3% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the metrics, showing it's relatively near its high but not at immediate resistance levels.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 115.37,
    "buy_range_min": 115.37,
    "buy_range_max": 121.14,
    "position_size": "moderate (5-7% of portfolio)",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 93)
- Volume patterns support the recent breakout
- The 50-day moving average is trending upward, providing support
- The high P/E ratio (90.53) suggests higher volatility risk
- Strong fundamental ratings support a more confident position size despite the volatility

These determinations are based on clear technical patterns visible in both daily and weekly charts, supported by strong fundamental metrics. The stock appears to be in a technically sound position for consideration of a new position, provided proper risk management protocols are followed.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock appears to have formed a cup-with-handle pattern, with a recent breakout around $268. The pattern shows proper depth and duration, with the handle forming in a constructive manner. The most recent buy point was established at approximately $268.35.

2. Buy Range:
With the identified buy point at $268.35, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level, putting the upper limit at approximately $281.77.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's strong fundamental metrics (98 Composite Rating, 97 EPS Rating) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio could be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $281.35, the stock is about 4.8% above its buy point of $268.35, which means it's not yet technically extended but is approaching that threshold.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently only 5% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength and momentum.

Here's the formatted output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 268.35,
    "buy_range_min": 268.35,
    "buy_range_max": 281.77,
    "position_size": "7-8%",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong institutional support with above-average volume on up days
- The RS line is showing strength, confirming the price action
- The base pattern is technically sound with proper depth and time requirements
- Strong fundamental metrics support the technical setup
- Current market conditions and sector strength should be considered before making any entry decisions</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows two clear buy points:
- First at $87.42 (earlier breakout)
- Second at $95.23 (more recent breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern)
The most recent pattern appears to be a consolidation near the $95.23 level.

2. Buy Range:
Given the $95.23 buy point, the buy range would typically extend 5% above:
- Lower end: $95.23
- Upper end: $100 (approximately 5% above buy point)

3. Position Size:
Considering the strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 92 EPS Rating) but also noting the stock's volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock shows relatively controlled price action with good volume characteristics.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $92.10, the stock is actually below the most recent buy point of $95.23, indicating it's not extended. In fact, it's pulling back within a normal range.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is only 5% off its 52-week high, indicating strong relative strength and maintaining an upward trend.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 95.23,
    "buy_range_min": 95.23,
    "buy_range_max": 100.00,
    "position_size": "7-8% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": false,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamental metrics with a 99 Composite Rating
- Volume patterns support the technical setup
- The RS line (blue) shows relative strength vs the market
- The current pullback might offer a secondary entry point if the stock rebounds from its moving averages
- Risk management should consider the broader market conditions and sector performance</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The most recent buy point appears to be from a handle-like pattern at around $165, with the breakout occurring recently. The stock has shown strong technical action with multiple prior successful base patterns and breakouts.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the current price at $173.72 and the recent buy point around $165, we can establish a reasonable buy range of 5% above the buy point (approximately $165-$173).

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but also considering its relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently trading about 5.2% above its recent buy point, putting it right at the edge of being extended.

5. Proximity to High:
According to the metrics provided, the stock is only 5.2% off its 52-week high, indicating it's very close to its high.

    "buy_range_max": 173.25,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Reasoning:
- The buy point is based on the recent handle-like pattern breakout
- Buy range extends 5% above the buy point
- Position size recommendation considers the strong fundamentals but also the stock's volatility
- Extended status is marked as true since it's at the 5% threshold from the buy point
- Near high is true as it's only 5.2% off its 52-week high

The stock shows strong technical and fundamental characteristics, but investors should be cautious about entering new positions at current levels since it's slightly extended from its proper buy point.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics, here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock shows a clear breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $34.77. This is visible on both daily and weekly charts, with strong volume confirmation during the breakout.

2. Buy Range:
Given the identified buy point of $34.77, the traditional buy range would extend up to approximately $36.50 (5% above buy point). However, the stock has already moved significantly beyond this range.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's high volatility (as evidenced by the wide price swings) and strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 98 RS Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate to manage risk.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently trading at $53.75, which is significantly above the last proper buy point of $34.77. This puts it well beyond the 5% buy range, making it extended from its proper buy point.

5. Proximity to High:
With only 7.1% off its 52-week high and showing strong momentum, the stock is relatively near its high. The recent pullback appears to be normal consolidation.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 34.77,
    "buy_range_min": 34.77,
    "buy_range_max": 36.50,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows exceptional relative strength (RS Rating: 98)
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The current pullback (-5.45%) might offer a secondary entry point if it finds support at key moving averages
- The strong fundamental metrics (EPS Growth: 263%, Sales Growth: 80%) support the technical picture

Recommendation: While the stock shows strong fundamentals and technicals, it's currently extended from its proper buy point. Investors should wait for either a pullback to support levels or the formation of a new base before considering new positions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a recent cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $144.87. The stock has already broken out of this pattern and moved significantly higher. The most recent consolidation appears to be forming near the $200 level.

2. Buy Range Assessment:
Given the current price of $194.74 and the stock's recent movement, it's currently extended from its last proper buy point at $144.87. No new proper buy range can be established until a new base forms.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but elevated volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The recent price action shows increased volatility.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is clearly extended from its last proper buy point at $144.87. It's moved well beyond the standard 5% buy range from that level.

5. Proximity to High:
Currently 9.2% off its 52-week high, showing strong relative strength with a 98 RS Rating. The stock is maintaining a strong upward trend despite recent pullback.

Here's the technical data output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 144.87,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "15-20% of portfolio maximum",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Explanation of null values:
- Buy range min/max are null because the stock is currently extended and needs to form a new base before establishing a new buy range. Investors should wait for a new proper base to form before considering new positions.

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows excellent fundamental metrics supporting its technical strength
- Volume patterns have been healthy on advances
- The current pullback might lead to the formation of a new base, which should be monitored for potential future entry points
- The strong RS line confirms institutional support</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
I can see a clear cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $18.28. This is marked on the chart and forms a technically sound base pattern. The handle shows proper price contraction and lower volume, which is ideal for this formation.

2. Buy Range:
With the buy point at $18.28, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level. This gives us a range from $18.28 to approximately $19.19.

3. Position Size:
Given the strong fundamental metrics (Composite Rating: 98, RS Rating: 99) and relatively controlled volatility shown in the base pattern, this could warrant a standard position size. However, the high P/E ratio of 75.25 suggests some additional risk.

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $27.09, the stock is significantly extended from its $18.28 buy point (approximately 48% above). This puts it well beyond the 5% buy range.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 15.2% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics. This suggests it's in a consolidation phase but still relatively near its high.

Here's the JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 18.28,
    "buy_range_min": 18.28,
    "buy_range_max": 19.19,
    "position_size": "7-8% of portfolio maximum",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 99)
- Volume patterns support the base formation
- The current consolidation might offer new entry points if it forms a proper base
- Investors should wait for a new proper base to form given the extended status from the previous buy point
- The high fundamental ratings support the technical pattern but the elevated P/E ratio suggests caution in position sizing</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock has recently formed what appears to be a cup-with-handle pattern. The most recent buy point was around $134.40, which served as a breakout point from a proper base formation. The stock has moved up significantly from this level.

2. Buy Range Assessment:
Given the current price of $154.27 and the most recent buy point at $134.40, the stock is currently extended beyond the typical 5% buy range from that entry point.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 98 EPS Rating) but relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's presence on the IBD 50 and Leaderboard suggests it's a leading stock, but the high P/E ratio of 335.37 indicates additional risk.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently extended from its most recent proper buy point. It's trading approximately 15% above the $134.40 buy point.

5. Proximity to High:
With only 4.1% off its 52-week high and showing strong relative strength (RS Rating 99), the stock is indeed near its high.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 134.40,
    "buy_range_min": 134.40,
    "buy_range_max": 141.12,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The buy range max is calculated as 5% above the buy point ($134.40 Ã— 1.05 = $141.12)
- The position size recommendation considers the stock's strong ratings but high valuation
- The stock's strong technical and fundamental metrics (all near 99) suggest institutional support
- Investors should wait for a new base formation or pullback to support levels before considering new positions
- The high volume on recent price moves confirms institutional participation</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll analyze each aspect carefully:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a clear cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at approximately $32.97. This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with the handle forming after a rounded cup base.

2. Buy Range:
Given the $32.97 buy point, a standard 5% buy range would be from $32.97 to $34.62.

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and RS Rating of 98, but concerning EPS Rating of 36, a more conservative position size would be appropriate. 

4. Extended Status:
At the current price of $50.85, the stock is significantly extended from its buy point of $32.97 (approximately 54% above).

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 8.8% off its 52-week high according to the fundamental metrics, indicating it's relatively near its high but in a pullback phase.

Here's the formatted output:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 32.97,
    "buy_range_min": 32.97,
    "buy_range_max": 34.62,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": true
  }
}

Additional Analysis:
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 98)
- Volume patterns support the breakout from the cup-with-handle pattern
- The current pullback might present a secondary entry point, but investors should wait for a proper base to form
- The low EPS Rating (36) is a concern from a CANSLIM perspective
- The stock is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, showing overall technical strength despite the recent pullback

Note: New positions should not be initiated while the stock is extended from its proper buy point. Investors should wait for a new base to form or a proper secondary entry point to develop.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the provided charts and fundamental metrics, here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point: The chart shows a clear buy point at $86.91, which emerged from a cup-with-handle pattern. This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with strong volume confirmation on the breakout.

2. Buy Range: Given the $86.91 buy point, a standard 5% buy range would extend from $86.91 to $91.26.

3. Position Size: Given the stock's high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 81 EPS Rating), I would recommend a moderate position size of 5-7% of the portfolio.

4. Extended Status: At the current price of $99.90, the stock is extended approximately 15% above its proper buy point of $86.91, making it too extended for a new position.

5. Proximity to High: The stock is currently 11.9% off its 52-week high, as confirmed by the fundamental metrics provided.

Here's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 86.91,
    "buy_range_min": 86.91,
    "buy_range_max": 91.26,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Analysis Notes:
- The stock shows strong relative strength with a 99 RS Rating
- Volume patterns are healthy, showing institutional support
- The stock has formed a series of higher lows and higher highs
- Current pullback might offer a secondary buy point if it forms a proper base
- The 50-day moving average could provide support during pullbacks
- Strong fundamental metrics support the technical pattern

Recommendation: Wait for the stock to pull back and form a new base before considering a new position, as it's currently extended from its proper buy point.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on the provided charts and fundamental metrics, I'll perform a detailed CAN SLIM technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The chart shows a recent cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point around $639.10. The stock has recently broken out of this pattern with strong volume, indicating a valid breakout.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
With the identified buy point at $639.10, a standard 5% buy range would extend to approximately $671.05. The current price of $695.30 is slightly above this range.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but elevated volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's presence in the IBD 50 adds confidence.

4. Extended Status:
At $695.30, the stock is now extended beyond the ideal buy point by approximately 8.8%, putting it in extended territory.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is very close to its high, only 3.2% off its 52-week high, showing strong momentum but also increasing risk.

Additional Analysis Notes:
- Volume is running 45% above average, confirming institutional support
- The stock shows strong relative strength (RS Rating: 96)
- The current pattern shows healthy consolidation after a strong uptrend
- Risk is elevated due to the extended price, suggesting waiting for a pullback to the buy point
- The strong fundamental metrics support a longer-term holding period if entered at a proper buy point

Recommendation: While the stock shows excellent fundamentals and technical strength, it's currently extended beyond the ideal buy point. Investors should watch for a pullback to the buy range before considering new positions.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">I'll analyze the charts and provide a detailed technical analysis based on the CAN SLIM methodology.

Analysis:

1. Buy Point:
The chart shows several key buy points, with the most recent significant breakout occurring around $119.82 from a cup-with-handle pattern. The stock has shown strong technical action with support at its moving averages and high relative strength.

2. Buy Range:
Given the current price of $141.67 and the most recent breakout point at $119.82, the stock is currently extended beyond its ideal buy range. A proper buy range would have been between $119.82 and approximately $125.81 (5% above the buy point).

3. Position Size:
Given the stock's high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate. The recent increased volatility suggests higher risk.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is currently extended from its most recent buy point. It's trading approximately 18% above the $119.82 buy point, well beyond the standard 5% buy zone.

5. Proximity to High:
According to the provided metrics, the stock is 18.7% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not currently near its high point. The recent price action shows a pullback from higher levels.

Here's the technical data output in the requested format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 119.82,
    "buy_range_min": 119.82,
    "buy_range_max": 125.81,
    "position_size": "5-7% of portfolio",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The stock shows strong fundamental ratings (99 Composite, 99 EPS)
- Volume patterns support the technical action
- The stock is currently pulling back but maintaining above key moving averages
- The high RS Rating of 96 confirms strong relative strength versus the market
- Current market conditions and volatility suggest waiting for a new proper base to form before considering a new position

The stock would need to build a new base before presenting a fresh buying opportunity, as it's currently extended from its previous buy points.</p>

                            <p class="analysis-text">Based on my analysis of the RKLB (Rocket Lab) charts and fundamental metrics provided, here's my detailed technical analysis:

1. Buy Point Analysis:
The stock recently formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point around $33.34. The stock has already broken out above this level and made a significant move upward. Looking at the chart patterns, the most recent base formation and breakout has already occurred.

2. Buy Range Analysis:
Given the current price of $44.81 and the recent movement, the stock is well extended from its last proper buy point. A new base would need to form for a fresh buy range to be established.

3. Position Size Consideration:
Given the high volatility (as evidenced by the wide price swings) and the RS Rating of 99, suggesting strong momentum but also increased risk, a conservative position size would be appropriate, around 5-7% of a portfolio.

4. Extended Status:
The stock is clearly extended from its last proper buy point at $33.34. It's trading approximately 34% above that level, well beyond the standard 5% buy zone.

5. Proximity to High:
The stock is currently 16.1% off its 52-week high, as indicated in the fundamental metrics. The recent pullback suggests it's in a consolidation phase.

Here's the technical data in the requested JSON format:

{
  "technical_data": {
    "buy_point": 33.34,
    "buy_range_min": null,
    "buy_range_max": null,
    "position_size": "5-7%",
    "is_extended": true,
    "near_high": false
  }
}

Additional Notes:
- The buy range is listed as null because the stock is currently extended and needs to form a new base before a valid buy range can be established
- The high RS Rating (99) indicates strong relative strength versus the market
- The poor EPS Rating (16) suggests fundamental weakness despite technical strength
- The stock shows high volatility, which warrants caution in position sizing
- Investors should wait for a new base to form before considering new positions</p>

Palantir Technologies (PLTR), Nvidia (NVDA) rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Shopify (SHOP) headline another big week of earnings reports. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) reported a 4% operating profit decline on Saturday due to currency impacts tied to the conglomerate's non-U.S. dollar debt. The stock market rally suffered its worst week in months. The indexes broke or tested key levels in Friday's sell-off amid new Trump tariffs and a weak jobs report. Investors may have wanted to cut some stocks and overall exposure Friday. Have a game plan ready for Monday. AMD earnings Tuesday night will be key for AI demand broadly, especially with Arista Networks (ANET), Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB) also set to report. AI hardware and related sectors had been doing well until late last week, buoyed by strong capital spending forecasts by the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META). Nvidia stock and Palantir are on IBD Leaderboard. Palantir stock is on SwingTrader. Microsoft stock is on IBD Long-Term Leaders. Astera Labs stock, Shopify, Super Micro, Arista Networks, Nvidia and Palantir are on the IBD 50.

The 10-year Treasury yield edged up to 4.24%. Crude oil futures edged lower. OPEC+ on Sunday agreed to another big production increase in September, unwinding 2023 cuts a year early, and might consider further increasing output. Higher output will pressure prices, but help the cartel gain market share vs. ailing U.S. shale producers. It also will please President Trump.

Join IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nThe stock market rally suffered a weekly sell-off after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hit record highs Thursday, with the major indexes on Friday suffering their worst one-day loss in months. President Donald Trump imposed new tariff rates for dozens of countries, effective Aug. 7. A weak jobs report Friday revived Fed rate hopes, but also raised concerns about the economy, especially with core inflation also picking up. President Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following the job reports, claiming partisan bias. The move, widely criticized, may undermine faith in economic data going forward. Earnings were mixed during the week, with Meta among the many winners while fellow titan Amazon (AMZN) was a notable loser. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.9% in last week's stock market trading, testing its 50-day moving average on Friday. The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively, both undercutting their 21-day moving averages. The small-cap Russell 2000 sold off 4.2%, falling below its 50-day and 200-day lines. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) lost 3.3%, but closed above its 50-day line. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW) shed 3.7%, finishing below the 50-day. Arguably the market was due for a pullback. Will the Nasdaq and S&P 500 find their footing or drop down to their 50-day lines, while other indexes and ETFs break decisively below that key level? The 10-year Treasury yield dived 17 basis points to 4.22%, with nearly all of that decline coming Friday. The two-year Treasury yield, more closely tied to Fed policy, tumbled 21 basis points to 3.7%, including 25 basis points on Friday, to a three-month low. U.S. crude oil futures rose 3.3% to $67.33 a barrel, despite sliding 2.8% on Friday.

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) slumped 3.6%, even with Microsoft stock a big holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slipped 1.2%, with AMD stock a big SMH holding.

The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) dropped 3.8%.\n\nAfter rising steadily over the prior month, and strongly since early April, the stock market had a bad Friday to cap a tough week. Investors may have needed to cut some stocks late last week because they were losers or round-tripping gains. Simply trimming exposure also made sense When the market is falling, it's not easy to decide whether to sell down positions or to be patient. Having sell rules and a game plan ahead of time helps keep the emotions out. The key isn't to be right every time, but to find a strategy that works for you in terms of protecting your portfolio vs. riding winners for the long term. When the market is falling, see which stocks hold up the best and are first to rebound. These could be names to focus on if and when the market bounces. Palantir headlines earnings Monday night, AMD (plus Super Micro and Arista Networks) will be in focus late Tuesday, with Shopify early Wednesday. Investors also will get results from DoorDash (DASH), Fortinet (FTNT), Hims & Hers Health (HIMS), MercadoLibre (MELI), Caterpillar (CAT), Toast (TOST), Sezzle (SEZL), Twilio (TWLO), Disney (DIS), Constellation Energy (CEG), Vistra (VST) and Rocket Lab (RKLB), along with many more.

Even recent highflier Nvidia (NVDA) couldn't save the Dow Jones index on the stock market today. The Dow finished with a loss of 1.2%, or 542 points. But the gauge of blue-chips had lost more than 600 points during the first trading day of August. The S&P 500 skidded 1.6% lower, making it four straight days of losses. The Nasdaq composite was hit the hardest among large-cap stock trackers. It stumbled 2.2%, sinking well below the 21,000 level. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq tested their 21-day exponential moving averages Friday. Each index also hit new intraday highs Thursday, but finished lower that day. President Donald Trump was clearly unhappy with the July jobs report released Friday. He instructed a team to oust the head Bureau of Labor Statistics after the weak monthly numbers. The small-cap Russell 2000 index sank 2%, but closed off the day's lows. The Russell 2000 extended its losing streak to five straight sessions. It fell below its 200-day moving average and closed on its 50-day moving average. Losers squashed winners on the Nasdaq exchange by nearly 3-to-1. The ratio was around 12-5 negative on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq compared with Thursday, in preliminary numbers.\n\nIn other news out of Washington, Federal Reserve Gov.

Stock Market Today: This Power Stock Leads The S&P 500 Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) stood out with its roughly 12% gain on the stock market today. Shares popped after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit and revenue. It also issued third-quarter sales guidance topping views. Shares bounced off their 50-day line and blew past the previous 755 flat base buy point. It was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 Friday. LPL Financial Holdings (LPLA) sank 7.5% even after brokerage and financial advisory provider beat second-quarter earnings and sales estimates. Shares fell below their 50-day line and beyond the 7% loss area, triggering a sell signal. What To Do After Market Sell-Off. Palantir, AMD Lead Big Earnings"

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe most recent buy point appears to be from a handle-like pattern at around $165, with the breakout occurring recently. The stock has shown strong technical action with multiple prior successful base patterns and breakouts.\n\n2. Buy Range Analysis:\nWith the current price at $173.72 and the recent buy point around $165, we can establish a reasonable buy range of 5% above the buy point (approximately $165-$173).\n\n3. Position Size Consideration:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but also considering its relatively high volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is currently trading about 5.2% above its recent buy point, putting it right at the edge of being extended.\n\n5. Proximity to High:\nAccording to the metrics provided, the stock is only 5.2% off its 52-week high, indicating it's very close to its high.\n\nHere's the technical data output in the requested format:\n\n{\n  \"technical_data\": {\n    \"buy_point\": 165.00,\n    \"buy_range_min\": 165.00,\n    \"buy_range_max\": 173.25,\n    \"position_size\": \"5-7% of portfolio\",\n    \"is_extended\": true,\n    \"near_high\": true\n  }\n}\n\nReasoning:\n- The buy point is based on the recent handle-like pattern breakout\n- Buy range extends 5% above the buy point\n- Position size recommendation considers the strong fundamentals but also the stock's volatility\n- Extended status is marked as true since it's at the 5% threshold from the buy point\n- Near high is true as it's only 5.2% off its 52-week high\n\nThe stock shows strong technical and fundamental characteristics, but investors should be cautious about entering new positions at current levels since it's slightly extended from its proper buy point.",

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe stock shows a clear breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point at $34.77. This is visible on both daily and weekly charts, with strong volume confirmation during the breakout.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nGiven the identified buy point of $34.77, the traditional buy range would extend up to approximately $36.50 (5% above buy point). However, the stock has already moved significantly beyond this range.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's high volatility (as evidenced by the wide price swings) and strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 98 RS Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate to manage risk.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is currently trading at $53.75, which is significantly above the last proper buy point of $34.77. This puts it well beyond the 5% buy range, making it extended from its proper buy point.\n\n5. Proximity to High:\nWith only 7.1% off its 52-week high and showing strong momentum, the stock is relatively near its high.

The handle shows proper price contraction and lower volume, which is ideal for this formation.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nWith the buy point at $18.28, the standard buy range would extend up to 5% above this level. This gives us a range from $18.28 to approximately $19.19.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the strong fundamental metrics (Composite Rating: 98, RS Rating: 99) and relatively controlled volatility shown in the base pattern, this could warrant a standard position size.

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe chart shows a recent cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point around $639.10. The stock has recently broken out of this pattern with strong volume, indicating a valid breakout.\n\n2. Buy Range Analysis:\nWith the identified buy point at $639.10, a standard 5% buy range would extend to approximately $671.05. The current price of $695.30 is slightly above this range.\n\n3. Position Size Consideration:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (99 Composite Rating, 99 EPS Rating) but elevated volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate. The stock's presence in the IBD 50 adds confidence.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nAt $695.30, the stock is now extended beyond the ideal buy point by approximately 8.8%, putting it in extended territory.\n\n5.

Looking at the chart patterns, the most recent base formation and breakout has already occurred.\n\n2. Buy Range Analysis:\nGiven the current price of $44.81 and the recent movement, the stock is well extended from its last proper buy point. A new base would need to form for a fresh buy range to be established.\n\n3.

Buy Range:\nWith the stock currently showing weakness and trading below key moving averages, it's not currently presenting a proper buy setup. Therefore, we cannot establish a valid buy range at this time.\n\n3.

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe chart shows a clear buy point at $82.67, which appears to be a breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern. This is visible in both the daily and weekly charts, with confirmation from increased volume at the breakout point.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nGiven the $82.67 buy point, a standard 5% buy range would extend from $82.67 to $86.80. However, the stock is currently trading at $88.30, which puts it slightly above this ideal buy range.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's relatively high volatility (as seen in the price swings) and mixed fundamental metrics (strong RS Rating of 95 but weak EPS Rating of 33), a more conservative position size would be prudent. \n\n4. Extended Status:\nAt $88.30, the stock is approximately 6.8% above the $82.67 buy point, which technically puts it in extended territory (>5% above buy point).\n\n5.

The handle shows proper price contraction and the pattern formed over a reasonable timeframe.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nWith a buy point of $61.50, a reasonable buy range would extend to approximately $64.57 (5% above buy point).\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (98 Composite Rating, 96 EPS Rating) but considering current market volatility, a moderate position size would be appropriate.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nAt the current price of $63.61, the stock is trading within the buy range from the $61.50 buy point, so it's not extended.\n\n5.

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe stock appears to have recently broken out of a cup-with-handle pattern, with a buy point around $20.00. The recent price action shows strong momentum with increased volume, supporting the breakout.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nGiven the $20.00 buy point, a reasonable buy range would extend to $21.00 (5% above buy point). The current price of $21.23 is slightly above this ideal buy range.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's high volatility (as seen in the chart patterns) and relatively high P/E ratio of 88.46, a more conservative position size would be prudent. The strong fundamental ratings (99 Composite Rating, 97 RS Rating) partially offset these risks.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nAt $21.23, the stock is currently extended beyond the ideal buy point of $20.00 by approximately 6%.\n\n5.

Buy Range Analysis:\nWithout a proper base formation completed, we cannot establish a specific buy range at this time. The stock needs to form a proper base pattern first.\n\n3. Position Size Consideration:\nGiven the high volatility (as seen in the recent price swings) and the poor fundamental metrics (EPS Rating of 19, SMR Rating of D), a conservative position size would be appropriate if entering a position.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is not currently extended from a buy point as it's actually pulling back from recent highs.\n\n5.

Buy Range Analysis:\nGiven the current price of $74.40 and the identified buy point, I can calculate a reasonable buy range.

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe stock appears to be in an uptrend, trading near its all-time highs. Looking at the daily and weekly charts, the stock has recently broken out of a flat base pattern around the $94-95 level. The buy point can be established at $95.20, which represents the breakout point from this consolidation pattern.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nWith the identified buy point at $95.20, a standard 5% buy range would extend to $99.96. The current price of $96.96 falls within this buy range.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (Composite Rating: 97, EPS Rating: 92) and relatively moderate volatility, a position size of 7-8% of the portfolio would be appropriate. This recommendation is based on the stock's solid technical pattern and strong institutional support as evidenced by the volume patterns.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nAt $96.96, the stock is approximately 1.8% above the buy point of $95.20, which means it is not extended from its proper buy point (would need to be >5% to be considered extended).\n\n5. Proximity to High:\nThe stock is very near its high, being only 2.1% off its 52-week high according to the fundamental metrics provided.

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe stock has recently made a significant move upward and appears to be breaking out of a consolidation pattern. Looking at the weekly chart, there was a previous buy point around the $350 level where it broke out of a consolidation pattern. However, the stock is currently trading well above that level at $401.80.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nGiven the current price action and momentum, it's difficult to establish a proper buy range as the stock appears extended from its most recent base. The stock has moved up sharply and is showing signs of being extended from its previous proper entry points.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's high volatility (as evidenced by the recent sharp price movements) and extended status, a more conservative position size would be prudent. The high RS Rating of 94 shows strong momentum but also increases risk.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is currently extended from its last proper buy point. The recent sharp move from around $350 to $401.80 represents a move of approximately 15%, putting it well beyond the typical 5% buy range.\n\n5. Proximity to High:\nAccording to the fundamental metrics, the stock is only 0.2% off its 52-week high, indicating it's very close to its high point.\n\nHere's the technical data in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"technical_data\": {\n    \"buy_point\": null,\n    \"buy_range_min\": null,\n    \"buy_range_max\": null,\n    \"position_size\": \"15-20% maximum of normal position size\",\n    \"is_extended\": true,\n    \"near_high\": true\n  }\n}\n\nExplanation of null values:\n- Buy point and buy range are marked as null because the stock is currently extended and not presenting a proper entry point. It would be prudent to wait for a new base to form or a pullback to support levels before establishing new buy points and ranges.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- The high RS Rating (94) shows strong relative strength\n- Volume is showing significant increase (76% above average)\n- The stock is showing strong momentum but is extended from proper buy areas\n- The weak EPS Rating (28) suggests fundamental caution despite technical strength\n\nRecommendation: Wait for the stock to build a new base or pull back to support levels before considering new entries.

Looking at the daily chart, there's a clear upward movement with strong volume support. The most recent buy point would have been around $125 when it broke out of its consolidation pattern.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nGiven the current price of $137.32 and the recent breakout level, I would establish a buy range between $125 (the breakout point) and $131.25 (5% above the breakout).\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (95 Composite Rating, 82 EPS Rating, 91 RS Rating) but considering its volatility, I would recommend a moderate position size of 5-7% of the portfolio.\n\n4.

Position Size:\nGiven the stock's strong fundamentals (97 Composite Rating, 96 EPS Rating) but considering its volatility and current market conditions, a moderate position size of 5-7% would be appropriate.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nAt the current price of $30.01, the stock is slightly extended from the ideal buy point but still within a reasonable range.\n\n5. Proximity to High:\nThe stock is currently 23.1% off its 52-week high, indicating it's not near its high point.\n\nHere's the formatted JSON output based on my analysis:\n\n{\n  \"technical_data\": {\n    \"buy_point\": 28.50,\n    \"buy_range_min\": 28.50,\n    \"buy_range_max\": 29.93,\n    \"position_size\": \"5-7%\",\n    \"is_extended\": true,\n    \"near_high\": false\n  }\n}\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The stock shows strong relative strength with a 96 RS Rating\n- Volume patterns support the recent price action\n- The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, showing positive technical strength\n- The high Composite Rating of 97 supports the technical setup\n- The stock's volatility and strong fundamental metrics (162% EPS growth, 102% sales growth) justify the suggested position size\n\nThe analysis suggests waiting for a pullback to the buy point before establishing a new position, given the slightly extended status from the ideal entry point.",

Buy Point Analysis:\nThe most recent significant buy point appears to be around $189.53, which formed from a cup-with-handle pattern. The stock has already moved significantly above this level, making it difficult to establish a new proper buy point at current levels.\n\n2. Buy Range:\nGiven the current price action and the stock's position relative to its recent base, I cannot establish a current valid buy range as the stock is extended from its last proper buy point.\n\n3. Position Size:\nGiven the stock's high volatility (as seen in the daily price swings) and strong fundamental metrics (99 Composite Rating, 98 EPS Rating), a moderate position size would be appropriate if entering at a proper buy point.\n\n4. Extended Status:\nThe stock is currently extended from its last proper buy point at $189.53. Trading at $235.21, it's well beyond the 5% buy zone from that level.\n\n5.
